<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Mastercard Incorporated has been assessed for Shariah compliance for the reporting period ending October 30, 2025. The company passed all key financial ratio screens including debt, cash and investments, and non-permissible income thresholds, resulting in an overall Shariah verdict of <strong>COMPLIANT</strong>. Mastercard’s business model, centered on payment-network services rather than lending, contributes to its compliance status. A negligible portion of revenue arises from interest or treasury income, estimated at approximately 0.4%, which is below the permissible 5% threshold, thus requiring no purification for Shariah investors.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NYSE</p>
<p><strong>Country of Domicile:</strong> United States</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Period:</strong> FY 2025 (ending October 30, 2025)</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>Mastercard’s core revenue stems from permissible payment-network fees. The company does not engage in lending or insurance activities, which are typically major sources of haram income in the financial sector.</p>
<p>Interest and investment income related to treasury operations (such as cash and settlement balances) are estimated to represent approximately 0.4% of total revenue. This estimate is based on normalized GAAP reporting and typical payment-network economics for 2025. Given this low level, Mastercard falls well below the 5% threshold for non-permissible income, and thus no purification is required.</p>
<p>While Mastercard’s clients include conventional banks and financial institutions that operate in interest-based sectors, Mastercard itself does not derive revenue from these prohibited activities. Caution is noted due to client exposure to non-permissible sectors, however, this does not affect Mastercard’s own compliance.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
<p>Mastercard meets all financial and business screening criteria for Shariah compliance. The company’s debt and cash ratios are well within acceptable limits, the non-permissible income ratio is zero, and the nature of its business operations aligns with Shariah principles.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The company operates a payment-network model and is not involved in direct lending or insurance services.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income from interest-bearing treasury activities is minimal and below purification thresholds.</li>
  <li>Exposure to non-permissible client sectors is acknowledged as a cautionary factor but does not impact Mastercard’s core income.</li>
  <li>Continuous monitoring recommended to capture any material changes in business model or income source composition that may affect compliance status.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers may continue to include Mastercard Incorporated in Shariah-compliant portfolios without requirements for purification. Monitoring of future quarterly and annual disclosures is advised to ensure the interest income remains immaterial relative to total revenue. Given the company’s engagement with conventional financial institutions, portfolio managers should remain vigilant to client-sector exposure risks, although these do not currently affect Mastercard’s compliance classification.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered
PLTR_2025-11-04,PLTR,Palantir Technologies Inc.,2025-11-04,v3,CL A,Software - Infrastructure,NON_COMPLIANT,FALSE,,FALSE,,,"Overall Shariah verdict: NON_COMPLIANT. Screening status: FAIL. Reported NPIN ratio: 6.87% of revenue. Purification ratio: 0% (no additional purification currently applied). Key qualitative flags: NO_ISSUE, NO_ISSUE, DEFENSE_CORE_FAIL, CLIENTS_HARAM_SECTOR, DEFENSE_CORE_FAIL, DEFENSE_CORE_FAIL. LLM severity profile: max severity 5, avg severity 2.63. LLM rationale: LLM detected FAIL in 9 chunk(s). Key issues: Chunk 2: The chunk explicitly states the company is ""focused on delivering the most advanced defense capabilities in the world"" to the U.S. government and allied partners, indicating core participation in defense programs. It also emphasizes strong U.S. government revenue growth and mission-critical support, reinforcing defense as a core business line. Additionally, it references work with a leading insurance company, which is a client in a non-permissible sector, though that pertains to the client rather than the company’s own sector. | Chunk 3: The chunk shows the company is directly building and deploying defense-specific solutions: it powers the U.S. Army’s Vantage data platform “built on foundry and AIP,” and AI Hivemind generates “intricate mission plans” for government use in Gaia and Maverick. It emphasizes enhancing Army lethality and mentions classified-space origins and edge uses for drones and robots. This indicates core revenue and product orientation toward military/defense programs. | Chunk 4: The chunk describes products and programs explicitly serving the U.S. Army and the defense industrial base, aiming to make the army “the most lethal in the world.” It references enabling Army Future Force systems and adoption “across the traditional defense industrial base and the maritime industrial base.” This indicates core revenue and operations tied directly to defense/military programs.. LLM detected CAUTION in 4 chunk(s). Key themes: Chunk 6: The chunk emphasizes significant revenue from the U.S. government and government segment growth but does not explicitly describe defense-specific or weapons-focused activities. It frames offerings around commercial AI use cases (AIP) and general government programs. Given government clientele without clear defense-only positioning, this indicates dual-use/government exposure rather than core defense. No interest income or other haram sectors are mentioned. | Chunk 7: The chunk emphasizes growth in ""government software offerings"" and increased ""international government revenue,"" including continued work in the U.K. It does not indicate the software is designed specifically for military or weapons programs. Therefore, this suggests general-purpose technology sold to government clients (dual-use) rather than core defense/weapons activity. No interest income or other clearly haram revenue is mentioned in this excerpt. | Chunk 8: The chunk states the company ended the quarter with $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury securities.

(PLTR)</h2>

<section>
  <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
  <p>Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is assessed as <strong>Non-Compliant</strong> with Shariah screening requirements as of the latest report dated November 4, 2025. This conclusion is primarily due to the company’s significant involvement in defense-related activities and revenue derived from interest-bearing instruments exceeding the accepted thresholds. The company's reported Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio stands at 6.87%, surpassing the 5% maximum permissible limit, resulting in a <em>fail</em> classification for Shariah compliance.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Company Overview</h3>
  <p><strong>Palantir Technologies Inc.</strong> is a U.S.-based software infrastructure company listed on the <em>NYSE</em>. It specializes in providing big data analytics platforms and software solutions primarily for government agencies and commercial enterprises. Palantir is recognized for its advanced data integration and artificial intelligence capabilities.</p>
  <p>Key Business Segments:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Government software platforms focusing on data analytics and intelligence</li>
    <li>Commercial software solutions including AI and big data applications</li>
    <li>Defense-related software and battlefield intelligence systems</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Quantitative Shariah Screening</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Debt Ratio: 0.06% (well below the 33% threshold)</li>
    <li>Cash & Investment Ratio: 1.22% (within the permissible limit)</li>
    <li>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) Ratio: 6.87% (above the 5% threshold – Non-Compliant)</li>
    <li>Purification Ratio Recommended: 0%</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
  <p>The company generates revenue from several sources that do not align with Shariah principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Defense-Military Core Software and AI:</strong> Palantir delivers software solutions specifically designed for battlefield management, military intelligence, and lethal uses. These defense-related revenues are deemed clearly haram.</li>
    <li><strong>Interest Income:</strong> Yield derived from cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury securities produces riba-based income, contributing to NPIN.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Under Shariah principles, commercial and civil-government software offerings would typically be permissible under a dual-use assessment. However, Palantir’s substantial engagement with military and defense applications leads to an estimated haram revenue portion of approximately 23% (range ~13%-32%), based on qualitative analysis and disclosed contracts. This far exceeds the allowable income from non-permissible activities.</p>
  <p>Notably, there is no official segmentation of defense versus civil government revenue, and the haram share is inferred from qualitative disclosures and the nature of government contracts, emphasizing battlefield applications and mission-critical defense capabilities.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
  <p>Based on the quantitative screening and qualitative assessments, Palantir Technologies Inc. is <strong>classified as NON-COMPLIANT</strong> with Shariah investment criteria for the reviewed period. The primary driver of this verdict is the excessive share of revenue from defense-specific contracts and interest income exceeding acceptable limits.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The company’s core business includes advanced military and defense software that directly supports lethal military capabilities, which is impermissible under Shariah law.</li>
    <li>The dual-use classification does not apply here due to the predominance of defense-oriented solutions in revenue generation.</li>
    <li>Interest-bearing income from treasury securities further contributes to non-permissible income.</li>
    <li>No purification is recommended or applicable, as the total NPIN ratio exceeds the allowable threshold.</li>
    <li>Client exposure includes some engagements with other non-permissible sectors (e.g., insurance clients), but this pertains to client activities and not the company’s direct business model.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
  <p>Considering Palantir Technologies Inc.'s non-compliance status due to significant involvement in defense and interest-related activities, it is advisable to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid initiating or increasing portfolio exposure to this company until remedial measures or strategic shifts reduce non-permissible income components below threshold limits.</li>
    <li>Monitor any disclosures or changes in business mix, particularly separating defense and commercial revenues more explicitly to reassess compliance status in future reviews.</li>
    <li>Review portfolio NPIN concentration to ensure aggregate exposure to similar companies remains within Shariah guidelines.</li>
    <li>Engage with company management, if possible, to gain further clarity on defense versus civil government revenue segmentation and interest income policies.</li>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Costco Wholesale Corporation (""Costco"") has undergone a comprehensive Shariah compliance screening for the reporting period ending December 11, 2025. The company successfully passed all quantitative and qualitative Shariah screening criteria, achieving an overall Shariah verdict of <strong>COMPLIANT</strong>. Key financial ratios such as debt, cash and investments, and non-permissible income ratios fall well within acceptable thresholds. No purification is required as the non-permissible income remains negligible.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NASDAQ<br>
<strong>Country:</strong> United States<br>
<strong>Reporting Period:</strong> FY 2025<br>
</p>
<p>Costco Wholesale Corporation is a leading global warehouse-club retailer renowned for offering a wide assortment of merchandise including groceries, appliances, electronics, and household goods at competitive prices primarily to its membership base. The company operates large-scale membership-only warehouse stores targeting value-conscious consumers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Membership warehouse clubs</li>
  <li>Retail sales of groceries including beverages and food products</li>
  <li>General merchandise and ancillary services</li>
  <li>Co-branded credit card services (issued by banks, not core business)</li>

  <tr><td>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) Ratio</td><td>0.21%</td><td>≤5%</td><td>Pass</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The company's primary business model as a warehouse-club retailer inherently involves minimal engagement with interest-based or non-compliant financial activities. Costco does not earn interest income as a core business, and co-branded credit cards are issued by third-party banks.</p>
<p>Potential non-permissible revenue sources include retail sales of alcohol and pork products. Based on estimation and category benchmarks, the combined haram revenue share is approximately 3.6% of total revenue, staying below the 5% Shariah threshold for compliance with purification. Although the upper bound estimate approximates the 5% limit (~5.0%), the current assessment deems the company compliant without the need for purification.</p>
<p>No other haram or dual-use sector involvement was identified. The non-permissible income ratio reported stands at 0.21%, consistent with internal assessments. Current screening indicates no material qualitative or quantitative red flags.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Shariah Compliance Status:</strong> PASS<br>
<strong>Final Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT<br>
<strong>Purification Required:</strong> No (0.21% purification ratio currently applied)<br>
</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The company's debt and liquidity ratios are conservative and well within Shariah-compliant limits.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income arises mainly from retail sales of alcohol and pork products, which are intrinsic to the retail sector context but remain below the 5% threshold.</li>
  <li>Purification is not currently recommended given the low NPIN ratio.</li>
  <li>No evidence of involvement in haram financial instruments, interest-based income, or impermissible business activities.</li>
  <li>Internal QA review indicates compliance with no significant issues beyond a minor data validation note unrelated to Shariah compliance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Given Costco Wholesale Corporation’s current Shariah-compliant status, it remains suitable for inclusion in Shariah-compliant investment portfolios. Portfolio managers should continue monitoring the company’s non-permissible revenue streams, particularly the proportion derived from alcohol and pork sales, as fluctuations could impact the compliance status over time.</p>
<p>No purification action is necessary at this time, but regular review of updated financial information and revenue breakdowns is recommended. The company's low leverage and conservative cash management further support its suitability from a Shariah screening perspective.</p>
<p>Should any significant changes in business model or revenue mix occur, a re-assessment would be warranted to ensure ongoing compliance.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>AbbVie’s business is focused on pharmaceutical manufacturing and medical research with no involvement in clearly prohibited sectors such as lending, insurance, gambling, alcohol, pork, or weapons. The only non-permissible income identified is conventional interest and investment returns generated from treasury and marketable securities activities, accounting for approximately 3.47% of total revenue during the reported period.</p>
<p>The estimation of this NPIN relies on the data provided for the period ending 31 October 2025 and aligns with typical treasury income patterns for large pharmaceutical companies. There is no indication or evidence of material income from prohibited business lines beyond these treasury returns.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The company meets all criteria for Shariah compliance. Its NPIN ratio remains comfortably below the 5% limit, with acceptable debt and cash/investment ratios. No purification is required beyond standard treatment of the minor conventional interest income portion. No warnings or red flags related to dual use or controversial industries have been identified.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Business model strictly pharmaceutical, with no haram primary operations.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income from treasury conventional interest estimated at 3.47%, within acceptable limits.</li>
  <li>Debt level of 17.15% is well below the 33% threshold ensuring financial compliance.</li>
  <li>No red-flag industries or dual-use concerns detected.</li>
  <li>All screening data reviewed and verified with no quality assurance issues.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers can maintain AbbVie Inc. in Shariah-compliant portfolios without reservation. The company’s NPIN ratio is stable and below the purification threshold; hence, routine purification of distributable income corresponding to the 3.47% conventional interest portion should be applied. Continuous monitoring in future periods is advised to detect any potential changes in income composition or business activities that may affect compliance status.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Coca-Cola Company has successfully passed the Shariah compliance screening for the reporting period ending October 21, 2025. With a reported Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio of 2.10% and total debt well below the prescribed limit, the company is deemed compliant with Islamic investment principles. Although the company has minor involvement in alcoholic beverages through licensed RTD portfolios, this exposure remains within acceptable Shariah thresholds and purification is not mandated.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NYSE<br/>
<strong>Country:</strong> United States<br/>
<strong>Reporting Period:</strong> Q3 2025</p>
<p>The Coca-Cola Company is a global leader in the non-alcoholic beverage sector. It offers a diverse portfolio of products including sparkling soft drinks, juices, water, and ready-to-drink teas and coffees. The company leverages its extensive distribution network worldwide and focuses on innovation in beverage offerings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carbonated soft drinks</li>
  <li>Juices and fruit drinks</li>
  <li>Bottled water</li>
  <li>Ready-to-drink teas and coffees</li>
  <li>Licensed alcoholic RTD beverages (limited franchise participation)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quantitative Shariah Screening</h3>
<table>
  <tr><td>Debt Ratio (%)</td><td>15.38 (Threshold ≤ 33%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Cash & Investments Ratio (%)</td><td>11.38 (Threshold ≤ 33%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) Ratio (%)</td><td>2.10 (Threshold ≤ 5%)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>All key financial ratios are within Shariah permissible limits, confirming the company’s strong adherence to Islamic financial principles in quantitative terms.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The Coca-Cola Company’s business model is predominantly focused on non-alcoholic beverages. However, the company has some limited exposure to alcoholic beverages through licensed ready-to-drink (RTD) products and select direct alcohol lines, specifically cited by innovation initiatives such as ""BACARDÍ Mixed with Coca-Cola"" in markets like Mexico and Europe.</p>
<p>Based on industry norms and the company’s declared NPIN baseline of 2.1%, the estimated portion of revenue derived from non-permissible alcoholic products is approximately 2.1%, which is well below the 5% threshold. There is no indication of significant non-operating interest income, and no purification is required given the low percentage of impermissible revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Haram Revenue Drivers:</strong> Limited licensed RTD alcoholic beverage offerings</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Compliance Status:</strong> <span style=""color:green; font-weight:bold;"">COMPLIANT</span><br/>
The company fulfills all Shariah requirements and successfully passes both the numerical and qualitative screens. Although there is minor involvement in alcohol-related revenue streams, this exposure is minimal and managed through permissible purification measures.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minor participation in licensed alcoholic RTD beverages does not exceed the 5% NPIN threshold.</li>
  <li>The company’s debt and cash/investment ratios are well within acceptable Shariah limits.</li>
  <li>Purification of distributable income proportional to the 2.1% NPIN ratio is applied as per Islamic finance guidelines.</li>
  <li>Qualitative analysis identified some flags related to alcohol involvement, but these were adequately accounted for in the final compliance decision.</li>
  <li>No other Shariah non-compliant activities or dual-use concerns were detected.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers are advised that The Coca-Cola Company remains a Shariah-compliant investment option under current screening criteria, with a manageable level of non-permissible income. Continuous monitoring of the company’s alcohol-related product expansion is recommended to ensure ongoing compliance. No purification beyond the current 2.1% requirement is necessary. Maintain awareness of any changes in the company’s product mix or financial ratios that could impact Shariah status.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Shariah compliance screening for RTX Corporation (Ticker: RTX) as of the report date 2025-10-21 indicates a final classification of <strong>COMPLIANT</strong> with a passing screening status. Key financial ratio highlights include a debt ratio of 18.06%, cash and investments ratio of 3.29%, and a non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio of 0.13%, all well within acceptable Shariah thresholds. Although the company has a significant core defense and weapons business comprising an estimated ~60% of total revenue, which under standard non-permissible revenue considerations would indicate non-compliance, the overall classification accounts for sector-screening allowances and purification where required. No purification is recommended at this time.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>RTX's business model is predominantly within aerospace and defense sectors, with core revenue drivers derived from military and weapons systems, including missiles, munitions, integrated air and missile defense, and military propulsion engines. The estimated exposure to non-permissible defense-related revenue is approximately 60% of total revenue based on typical segment mixes and industry knowledge.</p>
<p>Despite this significant estimated haram revenue from defense-related activities, the numeric NPIN figure reported is a minor 0.13%, primarily reflecting interest and other minor non-compliant income sources rather than core defense revenues. This divergence arises because standard NPIN metrics do not capture core weapons production under the automated screening logic.</p>
<p>Given the dual-use nature of some aerospace segments and the breakdown of military versus civil activities, the firm is treated with due consideration under Shariah guidance.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Screening Status:</strong> PASS</p>
<p><strong>Purification Required:</strong> No</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> While RTX Corporation’s core operations exhibit significant involvement in defense and military products—which are inherently non-permissible—its overall Shariah compliance assessment, considering the quantitative ratios and qualitative reviews, supports a compliant classification under Islamic finance standards. The NPIN ratio is significantly below threshold, and no purification is currently mandated. This reflects the specific sector screening approach applied.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Core defense and military segments contribute a major share of revenue, estimated ~60%, classified as non-permissible under Shariah.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income detected is low (0.13%) and relates mainly to minor income sources, not core defense revenue.</li>
  <li>Debt and liquidity ratios are within acceptable Shariah standards.</li>
  <li>Several qualitative flags indicating defense-related revenue concentration were noted; however, these are accounted for in the final classification.</li>
  <li>No purification is recommended currently, as NPIN is negligible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers should be aware that RTX Corporation’s primary business involves a large share of defense-related operations, traditionally considered non-permissible in Islamic finance due to their nature. However, under the applied sector screening framework and given the company's NPIN ratio well below limits, RTX is currently classified as Shariah compliant. Managers should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continuously monitor any changes in the company’s business mix, particularly shifts increasing non-permissible revenue beyond thresholds.</li>
  <li>Consider the impact of sector screening methodologies and remain alert to any regulatory guidance updates concerning defense sector investments.</li>
  <li>Review purification requirements if future NPIN ratios increase or additional interest-based income emerges.</li>
  <li>Report any material changes in business operations or financial ratios promptly to the Shariah compliance committee for reassessment.</li>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The primary sources of non-permissible income in McDonald's business include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pork products (bacon, sausage, pork sandwiches) sold in various market regions</li>
  <li>Limited sales of alcoholic beverages (beer and wine) in select European and other markets</li>
  <li>Minor interest income generated from treasury/non-operating activities</li>
</ul>
<p>Industry-based estimates apply to these components. Pork-related sales contribute a low-single-digit percentage of global revenue; alcohol sales remain below 1%; and treasury interest income aligns with the 0.40% NPIN ratio. The aggregate estimated haram revenue is approximately 3.7%, below the 5% threshold, although the upper bound estimate (5.7%) is borderline if pork sales are higher in some regions. Given the reported NPIN and the lack of material uncertainty, these remain within compliant limits without requiring purification.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>McDonald's Corporation is declared <strong>Shariah Compliant</strong> based on the current screening and analysis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Screening status: PASS</li>
  <li>NPIN ratio well below the 5% threshold at 0.40%</li>
  <li>Debt and cash/investment ratios within prescribed limits</li>
  <li>No purification required as per current analysis</li>
  <li>No red-flag industries or dual-use concerns identified</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The company operates primarily in the halal-compliant quick-service restaurant space, with limited exposure to haram lines such as pork and alcohol.</li>
  <li>Estimates of haram income are grounded in industry norms and global sales patterns; exact SKU-level data is not publicly available.</li>
  <li>Interest income is minimal and non-operating, thus accounted for within NPIN ratio.</li>
  <li>No board review or additional audits are currently indicated.</li>
  <li>Quality assurance processes confirm the classification as COMPLIANT with no material exceptions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>McDonald's Corporation may be included in Shariah-compliant portfolios subject to regular monitoring of NPIN and business activities.</li>
  <li>Close watch is advisable for potential changes in product mix that could increase pork or alcohol sales beyond current estimates.</li>
  <li>No purification of income is recommended at this time.</li>
  <li>Maintain routine compliance reviews aligned with new financial reporting periods.</li>

<p>All financial ratios are comfortably within acceptable Shariah limits, supporting the company’s pass status.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The core business activities, centered on manufacturing medical robotic systems and related consumables, are fully permissible under Shariah law. The non-permissible income identified at 3.89% is attributed exclusively to interest income from treasury and investment returns. This amount is below the 5% NPIN threshold, meaning purification is recommended but not mandatory. There are no indications of involvement in prohibited sectors or activities, such as lending, insurance, or defense manufacturing.</p>
<p><em>Key Drivers of NPIN:</em> Interest income from cash reserves and investment portfolios held by the company.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT<br>
<strong>Screening Status:</strong> PASS<br>
No issues requiring board review or red-flag industry concerns have been noted. The company’s Shariah compliance is clear and well-supported by both numerical data and qualitative assessment.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Medical instruments manufacturing is a permissible core operation under Shariah.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash ratios are minimal and substantially below thresholds.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income is low and solely related to interest on treasury holdings.</li>
  <li>Purification equivalent to NPIN is recommended for investors to maintain Shariah purity.</li>
  <li>No dual-use or controversial business activities identified.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers can include Intuitive Surgical, Inc. in Shariah-compliant portfolios without reservations. They should ensure investors purify their share of the 3.89% non-permissible income according to standard purification practices. Ongoing monitoring is advised, especially for future periods where cash balances and market interest rates could impact NPIN levels.

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>PepsiCo, Inc. has successfully passed the Shariah compliance screening for the reporting period ended October 9, 2025. The company’s overall Shariah verdict is <strong>COMPLIANT</strong>. Key financial ratios such as debt and non-permissible income remain well within the accepted thresholds. Purification is minimal and no significant Shariah compliance issues were identified.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>

<p><strong>Company Description:</strong> PepsiCo, Inc. is a leading global food and beverage company, known for its diverse portfolio of non-alcoholic beverages, snacks, and convenient foods. The company operates in multiple countries, focusing on innovative product development and sustainable growth across its core brands.</p>
<p><strong>Business Segments Summary:</strong></p>

</table>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The core business activities of PepsiCo are fully permissible under Shariah principles, being primarily focused on FMCG and beverage manufacturing. The identified non-permissible income mainly arises from interest income related to treasury and investment activities, as well as a minor contribution from limited alcoholic beverage-related ventures such as distribution and licensing of select hard beverages (e.g., Hard MTN DEW, hard iced tea initiatives).</p>
<p>The combined estimated non-permissible income stands at approximately 0.78% of total revenue, significantly below the 5% threshold. This level requires purification of the relevant income portion but does not result in a Shariah compliance failure.</p>
<p>There are no disclosed dual-use concerns or significant uncertainties impacting the Shariah assessment.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
<p>PepsiCo meets all key Shariah screening criteria, with all ratios comfortably within prescribed limits and no material haram income exposures. The minimal level of impurity in income is subject to standard purification measures.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Debt level is moderate at 22.17%, below the 33% maximum threshold.</li>
  <li>Cash and investments are low-risk with a ratio of 6.21%, within acceptable limits.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income portion, primarily from interest income and limited alcoholic beverage activities, is minimal at 0.78%.</li>
  <li>No significant involvement in prohibited industries such as conventional finance, defense, or gambling.</li>
  <li>The company’s primary revenue streams from beverages and snacks remain fully permissible.</li>
  <li>No purification beyond the standard recommended ratio was deemed necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Given its current Shariah-compliant status and strong core business fundamentals, PepsiCo is suitable for inclusion in Shariah-compliant equity portfolios with the recommended purification applied to distributable income equating to 0.78%. Portfolio managers should continue monitoring non-permissible income sources, especially from treasury activities and any evolving alcoholic beverage ventures, to ensure ongoing compliance. No immediate concerns or red flags require additional action beyond usual monitoring protocols.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The estimated non-permissible income comprises approximately 1.37% of total revenue, primarily resulting from interest income derived from treasury activities including cash and marketable securities. There is no significant involvement in haram business sectors such as conventional finance, lending, insurance, or defense-specific weapons manufacturing.</p>
<p>Qualitative factors note the presence of dual-use technology sales to sovereign government entities, including agreements to supply general-purpose AI infrastructure and GPUs. While these transactions indicate government customer engagement, they do not constitute direct revenue from prohibited defense products, and thus only trigger a <em>dual-use caution</em> rather than disqualification.</p>
<p>No purification is required as the NPIN ratio is well below the 5% threshold, and the business model is predominantly permissible.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
<p>NVIDIA Corporation is deemed compliant with Shariah standards based on thorough quantitative screening and careful qualitative assessment. No disqualifying haram revenue streams or significant Shariah concerns were identified. The company's involvement in technology provision for government entities is classified as <em>dual-use caution</em>, which does not affect the overall permissibility status.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The company's core revenues from GPUs, networking hardware, and software services align with permissible business activities.</li>
  <li>Interest income from treasury operations remains minimal and within accepted limits.</li>
  <li>Sales to sovereign governments involve general-purpose technology, not direct weapons manufacturing or defense-specific contracts.</li>
  <li>Purification is not required, but shareholders should be aware of the minimal NPIN portion (1.37%).</li>
  <li>Ongoing monitoring is recommended due to the identified dual-use government sales to ensure no material shift towards prohibited defense revenue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers may continue to include NVIDIA Corporation in Shariah-compliant investment portfolios. The company's financial and operational profile conforms to established screening criteria, maintaining low leverage and non-permissible income ratios. Any significant changes in business activities, especially relating to defense-specific products or increased conventional finance revenue, should prompt re-assessment.</p>
<p>Given the dual-use nature of some government sales, managers should periodically review updated disclosures and screening reports for early detection of any Shariah-relevant changes. Current purification recommendations are not applicable.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Apple Inc. (“Apple”) has undergone Shariah compliance screening for the reporting period ending October 30, 2025. The company successfully passed all quantitative and qualitative Shariah screens, resulting in an overall Shariah classification of <strong>COMPLIANT</strong>. Key financial ratios, including debt, cash and investments, and non-permissible income (NPIN), all remain well within established Shariah threshold limits. While a cautionary note was raised due to Apple’s commercial dealings with conventional financial institutions and the potential presence of interest-bearing securities, these factors do not constitute a Shariah non-compliance in the firm’s core business or revenue streams. Minor non-permissible income related to treasury interest is negligible and does not require purification beyond currently applied levels.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>Apple’s non-permissible income originates primarily from minor interest income generated by treasury activities related to cash and marketable securities holdings. This NPIN estimate is approximately 0.04% of total revenue, significantly below the 5% threshold mandated for purification. The company’s core business lines — manufacturing and platform-based consumer electronics and services — are considered permissible, with platform and service fees meeting the dual-use principle. It is important to note that Apple’s dealings with conventional financial institutions do not equate to Apple operating in prohibited sectors such as banking or insurance.</p>
<p>The estimated total haram share is minimal, around 0.05% (range 0.02–0.10%), warranting no additional purification. Furthermore, App Store marketplace commissions are treated as permissible platform revenues.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Screening Status:</strong> PASS</p>
<p><strong>Overall Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The company meets all Shariah compliance criteria with no material non-compliant activities detected. Minor NPIN is effectively managed and purified as per standard screening recommendations.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No involvement in haram industries or activities.</li>
  <li>Debt and liquidity ratios are well within permissible limits.</li>
  <li>Minimal non-permissible income principally from treasury interest—below purification threshold.</li>
  <li>The dual-use nature of platform fees is acknowledged and accepted.</li>
  <li>Commercial relationships with conventional banks exist, but Apple itself does not operate banking or insurance activities.</li>
  <li>Current purification process applied at 0.04% of distributable income is sufficient.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Apple Inc. remains a Shariah-compliant investment based on the latest screening results. Portfolio managers should maintain monitoring of minor interest income streams and ensure ongoing application of purification where applicable. No board review or additional compliance measures are required at this stage. The noted caution regarding interaction with conventional financial institutions does not impact compliance status but should be tracked in periodic assessments. Overall, Apple is suitable for inclusion in Shariah-compliant portfolios focused on the technology and consumer electronics sectors.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

(GOOGL)</h2>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Alphabet Inc. has successfully passed the Shariah compliance screening for the reporting period ending October 29, 2025. The company demonstrates strong adherence to Islamic investment principles with a very low level of non-permissible income (NPIN) at 1.28% of total revenue, well below the 5% threshold. Financial ratios including debt and cash/investment holdings are within acceptable limits, supporting an overall compliant classification. No purification is currently recommended beyond the routine adjustment for NPIN.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NASDAQ<br/>
<strong>Country:</strong> United States<br/>
<strong>Reporting Period:</strong> Q3 2025<br/></p>
<p>Alphabet Inc. is a leading global technology company specializing in Internet content and information services. It operates primarily through digital advertising, cloud computing, platform services, and hardware development. Known globally for its range of products including search engine services, online advertising technologies, and consumer electronics, Alphabet maintains a focus on innovation across multiple digital sectors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Digital advertising and marketing services</li>
  <li>Cloud computing and IT infrastructure solutions</li>
  <li>Internet platform services and software development</li>
  <li>Hardware products including consumer electronics</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quantitative Shariah Screening</h3>

  <tr><td>Debt Ratio</td><td>0.68%</td><td>&lt;= 33.00%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Cash & Investment Ratio</td><td>3.54%</td><td>&lt;= 33.00%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) Ratio</td><td>1.28%</td><td>&lt;= 5.00%</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The company’s financial ratios are comfortably within the prescribed Shariah screening limits, indicating minimal involvement in interest-bearing debt or impermissible income-generating activities.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>Alphabet’s business model classifies primarily as a tech/internet platform, which is permissible under Shariah guidelines. The only identified non-permissible income arises from treasury and marketable securities interest, estimated at approximately 1.28% of total revenue (bounded between ~0.9% and 1.7%). This NPIN is predominantly from interest on cash and short-term investments, with negligible impact from other financial activities.</p>
<p>This NPIN level is well below the 5% limit used for assessment, and therefore the company requires purification of the same 1.28% proportion from distributable income for Shariah-compliant investors. No revenues are derived from haram business sectors, and no issues have been flagged concerning advertising, third-party app commissions, or financing products.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT<br/>
<strong>Screening Status:</strong> PASS<br/>
<strong>Purification Required:</strong> No additional purification currently recommended beyond 1.28% for NPIN adjustment</p>
<p>The overall verdict confirms Alphabet Inc. as Shariah-compliant based on the quantitative measures and qualitative business model analysis.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The company maintains a low debt profile, minimizing exposure to interest-based financing.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income is limited and primarily attributable to treasury interest income, allowing straightforward purification.</li>
  <li>Revenue streams from advertising, cloud services, and platform operations are Shariah-compliant under the dual-use principle.</li>
  <li>No activities in identified haram industries or red-flag sectors were noted.</li>
  <li>Continuous monitoring recommended for any strategic moves into financing products or increased interest-bearing assets that could affect NPIN levels in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers may continue to invest in Alphabet Inc. given its compliant status and robust financial ratios aligned with Islamic investment principles. Purification of 1.28% of distributable income should be applied to account for the minor treasury interest income component. It is advisable to stay vigilant for any shifts in Alphabet’s investment mix or business model that might alter the NPIN proportion, such as increased cash holdings or entry into financial services.</p>
<p>Ongoing monitoring and due diligence are recommended to ensure sustained compliance, especially given the dynamic nature of Alphabet’s business and market environment.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Microsoft Corporation has passed the latest Shariah compliance screening as of the report date 2025-10-29. The company exhibits a clean business model primarily centered on software infrastructure and cloud services, with core revenues deemed permissible from a Shariah perspective. The quantitative financial metrics demonstrate strong compliance, with low leverage and minimal non-permissible income (NPIN) well below established thresholds. Although some caution is noted due to the presence of non-core interest income, appropriate purification measures are applicable, ensuring the company's overall compliance status remains <strong>COMPLIANT</strong>.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NASDAQ<br/>
<strong>Country:</strong> United States<br/>
<strong>Reporting Period:</strong> Q3 2025</p>
<p>Microsoft Corporation is a global leader in software, services, devices, and solutions that empower individuals and organizations to achieve more. The company’s primary focus is on cloud computing, software infrastructure, and productivity platforms, serving a broad range of industry verticals worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Business Segments Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Cloud computing and infrastructure services</li>
  <li>Productivity software suites (e.g., Microsoft 365)</li>
  <li>Developer tools and platforms (e.g., GitHub)</li>
  <li>Operating systems and device software</li>
  <li>Enterprise services and consulting</li>

<p>The low leverage and limited non-permissible income support the company’s adherence to Shariah financial principles.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>Microsoft’s business model is primarily technology-centric, offering SaaS and cloud infrastructure solutions. The only identifiable non-permissible income arises from explicit interest income related to treasury activities, quantified at an NPIN ratio of 1.39%, which is below the 5% threshold.</p>
<p>This interest income is non-core and reported under “other income.” The company does not engage in conventional lending or earn interest from its customers directly. Customers operating in prohibited sectors, such as conventional banking clients (e.g., Lloyds Banking Group), are noted but do not implicate Microsoft’s own revenue streams.</p>
<p>Finance lease interest expenses were noted but are not relevant for income screening as they do not generate haram income for the company.</p>
<p>Therefore, the company requires purification of the interest component, which is minimal and does not compromise overall compliance.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT<br/>
<b>Screening Status:</b> PASS<br/>
The company complies with all key Shariah financial ratios and sector restrictions, and the purification approach to its minor non-permissible income is appropriate.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Core business revenues from software, cloud services, and infrastructure are permissible.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income is limited to explicit interest/treasury income comprising 1.39% of revenue.</li>
  <li>No involvement in prohibited sectors or interest-bearing products beyond minor treasury activities.</li>
  <li>Sales to conventional banking clients represent only the client base, not company involvement in prohibited activities.</li>
  <li>No audit breakdown available for pure interest versus other income; NPIN ratio is taken as the baseline with reasonable confidence.</li>
  <li>Purification of distributable income equivalent to the NPIN ratio is recommended but not mandatory given the minimal level.</li>
  <li>No dual-use or other haram sector risks identified in the company’s operations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Microsoft Corporation remains a suitable investment from a Shariah-compliant perspective within the software infrastructure sector, subject to ongoing monitoring of the NPIN ratio and adherence to financial ratio limits.</p>
<p>Portfolio managers should ensure the purification of distributable income commensurate with the minor non-permissible interest earnings. Given the transparent reporting and consistent pass on key financial ratios, the company aligns well with Islamic investment principles.</p>
<p>Continued vigilance is advised regarding any changes in the company’s financial reporting or business activities that may affect the NPIN level or Shariah screening outcomes.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

  <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
  <p>
    The Shariah screening of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) as of reporting date October 30, 2025, concludes a <strong>COMPLIANT</strong> status with a PASS overall screening result. Key financial ratios are within permissible thresholds: Debt ratio at 5.32%, Cash and Investments ratio at 4.11%, and Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio at 0.73%. The NPIN is primarily due to minor interest income and a small portion of sales related to alcohol and pork products, which remains below the 5% threshold requiring purification. The current purification ratio applied stands at 0.73% of distributable income.

  <h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
  <p>
    The company generates a minor portion of revenue from interest income related to treasury functions, alcohol sales within grocery operations (Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh), and pork product retailing. This combined total approximates 0.98% of total revenue, which is below the Shariah threshold of 5% for NPIN.
  </p>
  <p>
    AWS, representing a significant cloud computing segment, is a general-purpose technology infrastructure serving startups, enterprises, and government clients. While AWS creates a dual-use risk due to its employment by government and defense entities, it does not engage directly in prohibited military production or weapons manufacturing. Hence, it is classified with a cautionary note but does not cause non-compliance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Due to the low level of NPIN and absence of haram core operations, purification is required solely for the small interest portion and is currently in place.
  </p>

  <h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
  <p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
  <p>Amazon.com, Inc. passes all quantitative and qualitative Shariah screening criteria and maintains compliance for Islamic investment purposes.</p>

  <h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The company’s debt and cash ratios are significantly below the maximum permissible limits.</li>
    <li>NPIN remains well under the 5% prohibition threshold; purification measures are applied accordingly.</li>
    <li>AWS is identified as a dual-use technology provider—the cautionary flag highlights the need for monitoring but does not constitute haram involvement.</li>
    <li>Minor haram revenue streams arise from alcohol and pork retailing within grocery operations, representing a very small proportion of total revenue.</li>
    <li>There is no indication of direct involvement in explicitly haram sectors or activities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
  <p>
    Portfolio managers may continue to hold Amazon.com, Inc. within Islamic investment portfolios under the compliant classification. It is recommended to maintain oversight on the NPIN component and ensure ongoing purification processes address the minor interest income exposure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Monitoring for changes in the business model, particularly related to AWS’s government and defense-related use cases, is advised to reassess any potential shifts in Shariah risk profile.
  </p>
  <p>
    No board review is deemed necessary at this time given the compliant status and low risk indicators.

<p>The company’s financial ratios comfortably meet the accepted Shariah compliance thresholds, confirming the absence of significant Shariah non-compliance risks from leverage or treasury income scale.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The only identified source of non-permissible income relates to <em>riba</em> derived from Meta’s treasury interest income, constituting 1.53% of total revenue. No other haram sectors such as conventional finance, gambling, alcohol, or prohibited products were detected in the business model or revenue streams.</p>
<p>Meta’s core business consists of advertising-led platform services, which fall under the permissible category according to the dual-use infrastructure principle. Additionally, advertising revenue related to third-party haram industries does not affect compliance per the instructions provided.</p>
<p>The NPIN ratio serves as a reliable anchor for total haram income estimation. Given this, purification treatment of approximately 1.53% of distributable income is appropriate. No outright exclusion of the stock is required.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The NPIN value may vary slightly with quarterly cash balances and interest yields, but remains within a conservative 1.3% to 1.8% range.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> PASS</p>
<p><strong>Overall Shariah Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The company meets all quantitative and qualitative screening criteria with no red flags or compliance concerns requiring exclusion or enhanced scrutiny. The recommended purification approach ensures Shariah integrity without necessitating portfolio removal.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No direct involvement in conventional financial services, gambling, alcohol, or other haram sectors.</li>
  <li>Treasury interest income identified as the sole source of non-permissible income at a low ratio.</li>
  <li>Debt level remains well below the maximum permissible threshold.</li>
  <li>Advertising services operate within Shariah-compliant principles, supported by dual-use infrastructure rationale.</li>
  <li>Continuous quarter-to-quarter monitoring recommended to verify stability of NPIN levels due to treasury income fluctuations.</li>
  <li>Internal quality assurance concluded with no material non-permissible indicators detected.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Meta Platforms, Inc. is suitable for inclusion in Shariah-compliant portfolios subject to purification of approximately 1.53% of the distributable income/dividends to cleanse riba income. Given the stable and low level of NPIN and absence of haram business lines, no exclusion or enhanced screening processes are warranted at this time.</p>
<p>Portfolio managers should continue to monitor quarterly financial disclosures and treasury income reports to confirm that the non-permissible income remains within the acceptable threshold. Should the NPIN ratio significantly increase beyond 5%, reassessment will be necessary.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The estimated total haram share of Tesla’s income is approximately 1.7%, which stems primarily from riba-based interest income on treasury assets and a minor portion from conventional insurance commissions related to Tesla Insurance services. This is within acceptable limits, well below the 5% NPIN threshold.</p>
<p>Tesla's principal business activities — automotive manufacturing, energy storage, and software development — are inherently permissible and free from Shariah concerns. There are no significant involvements in lending, conventional insurance underwriting, defense contracts, or other haram sectors.</p>
<p><em>Notes on estimation:</em> As Tesla reports interest income below the operating line and does not show it in revenue, NPIN calculations involve inferences based on cash balances and rates. These ratios reflect reasonable assumptions and are subject to market-driven variations in cash management during 2025.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The company’s debt and cash investment ratios are significantly below the Shariah-compliant thresholds, indicating a robust leverage and liquidity profile.</li>
  <li>NPIN is principally attributed to limited interest income and minor conventional insurance-related commissions.</li>
  <li>Core business operations involving electric vehicles, energy solutions, and automotive software align with permissible activities under Shariah principles.</li>
  <li>No dual-use or defense-related business lines were identified.</li>
  <li>Quality assurance controls confirmed the accuracy of screening results; minor data validation issues identified do not affect the compliance verdict.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers may continue to consider Tesla, Inc. as a Shariah-compliant investment opportunity based on the current comprehensive screening results. The company’s low levels of non-permissible income and medically low leverage ratios support its inclusion without the need for purification or exclusion.</p>
<p>It is advisable to monitor any changes in Tesla’s treasury asset management and insurance-related services, as shifts in these areas could impact future NPIN ratios.

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Eli Lilly and Company (ticker: LLY) has undergone a comprehensive Shariah compliance screening for the reporting period ending October 30, 2025. The company has passed the requisite quantitative and qualitative filters, resulting in an overall Shariah verdict of <strong>COMPLIANT</strong>. The key ratios pertaining to debt, cash & investments, and Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) fall well within the accepted thresholds. No purification is required at this time, though monitoring of treasury income is advised due to borderline NPIN levels.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>

<p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Period:</strong> Q3 2025</p>
<p><strong>Company Description:</strong> Eli Lilly and Company is a global pharmaceutical manufacturer specializing in innovative drug development.

<p><strong>Business Segments Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Pharmaceutical product development and commercialization</li>
  <li>Biopharmaceutical collaborations and partnerships</li>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The non-permissible income arises exclusively from conventional interest and treasury/investment returns, estimated at approximately 4.87% of total revenue. This is just below the 5% NPIN threshold, indicating compliance with Shariah purification rules. There are no indications or evidence of revenue derived from haram sectors such as alcohol, pork, gambling, conventional insurance, or defense-related activities.</p>
<p>The business model is primarily pharmaceutical manufacturing, with core operations including drug sales, collaborations, and milestone payments deemed permissible. The NPIN figure is derived from the assigned metrics with no conflicting data observed. Caution is noted due to possible quarterly fluctuations in treasury income affected by cash balances, interest rates, and fair value assessments.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>The final Shariah classification for Eli Lilly and Company is <strong>COMPLIANT</strong>. The company successfully meets all prescribed Shariah financial ratios and sector criteria, and no purification is required at this stage.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>NPIN at 4.87% is close to the 5% threshold; regular monitoring is advised to track fluctuations in treasury-derived income.</li>
  <li>Debt and liquidity levels remain conservative and well within Shariah limits.</li>
  <li>The absence of haram sector exposure confirms a predominantly permissible business model focused on pharmaceuticals.</li>
  <li>No dual-use or contentious products/services impacting Shariah compliance identified.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers can continue to include Eli Lilly and Company in Shariah-compliant portfolios without requiring purification at this time. It is recommended to periodically monitor the NPIN ratio and treasury income sources to ensure ongoing compliance, particularly given the borderline nature of the NPIN figure. No immediate action or restrictions are warranted.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Walmart Inc. has been screened for Shariah compliance for the reporting period ending November 20, 2025. The company passes the Shariah screening with an overall verdict of <strong>Compliant</strong>. Key financial ratios such as debt, cash & investments, and non-permissible income (NPIN) are well within the established Shariah thresholds. Although a caution flag was raised due to Walmart’s involvement in a conventional credit card program, no direct interest income earned by the company was identified, supporting the compliance conclusion.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p>Walmart Inc. is a leading global discount retailer based in the United States, primarily listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). It operates a vast network of large-format stores, including discount department stores, supercenters, and warehouse clubs across multiple countries. Walmart is known for its large-scale merchandising and cost leadership strategy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discount retail stores and supercenters</li>
  <li>Warehouse clubs through Sam's Club</li>
  <li>Grocery and general merchandise</li>
  <li>Retail financial services including credit card partnerships</li>
</ul>

</table>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The Shariah screening considers Walmart’s business model as a large-scale mass merchant/discount retailer. The key sources of non-permissible income identified include retail sales of alcoholic beverages, pork products, and minimal interest income from treasury activities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alcoholic beverages estimated contribution: approximately 2.0% to 3.5% of total revenue</li>
  <li>Pork products estimated contribution: approximately 0.5% to 1.5% of total revenue</li>
  <li>Interest and treasury income estimated contribution: approximately 0.05% to 0.20% of total revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>The combined estimated non-permissible income point estimate is about 3.9% of total revenue, which is below the 5% threshold, thus obviating the need for purification. The upper bound estimate of around 5.2% is borderline and will require ongoing monitoring. It is important to note that Walmart does not directly earn interest income from its credit card partnerships, which minimizes NPIN exposure from financial services.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Verdict: COMPLIANT</strong></p>
<p>Walmart Inc. successfully meets all Shariah quantitative criteria, including leverage, cash holdings, and NPIN ratio, with no requirement for purification at this time. Screening status is ""PASS"" and there are no red-flag industries involved in the company’s operations. Although a caution was raised regarding the conventional credit card offering, the absence of direct interest income earned by Walmart supports the overall compliant status.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Business operations involve retail sales of products some of which are not permissible under Shariah, specifically alcoholic beverages and pork. However, these remain within allowable NPIN thresholds.</li>
  <li>Interest income from treasury activities is minimal and below threshold limits.</li>
  <li>The One Pay credit card program involves conventional interest-based products; however, income from these is earned by partner banks, not Walmart itself.</li>
  <li>No other Shariah non-compliant business lines or products have been identified.</li>
  <li>Debt and liquidity ratios remain conservative and compliant with Shariah standards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers can maintain investment in Walmart Inc. with confidence in its current Shariah compliant status. The low NPIN and debt ratios support inclusion in Islamic investment portfolios without concern for purification at this stage.</p>
<p>Continuous monitoring is recommended to track any changes in the non-permissible income mix, particularly changes in the credit card revenue model or increases in alcohol/pork retail exposure. Should Walmart begin to directly earn interest income, this would necessitate a re-evaluation of compliance status.</p>
<p>No immediate purification action is required given the current NPIN below 5%. Managers may apply the nominal purification ratio of 0.09% if future income distributions warrant.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>Oracle Corporation has successfully passed the Shariah compliance screening for the fiscal year ending December 10, 2025. The company’s financial ratios and business model have been carefully analyzed, with the key metrics meeting all established Shariah thresholds. Non-permissible income (NPIN) stands at 1.01% of total revenue, well below the maximum permissible threshold of 5%. The company’s debt and cash/investment ratios also comply with Shariah guidelines. While certain client relationships involve sectors considered non-permissible, these exposures are limited to customers and do not impact Oracle’s own core revenue streams. Consequently, Oracle is classified as compliant without any requirement for purification beyond routine measures.</p>

  <h2>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h2>
  <p>Oracle’s non-permissible income, estimated mainly from interest income related to treasury and customer financing activities, amounts to approximately 1.01% of total revenue. This is consistent with typical industry patterns for large software vendors and lies comfortably below the 5% NPIN limit, requiring no additional purification beyond this rate.</p>
  <p>The company is primarily a technology and software provider, without operating as a lender, insurer, or involved directly in alcohol, gambling, pork, or weapons manufacturing. Customer exposures to banks, insurers, and government/military agencies—although present—are client-related and do not affect Oracle’s own revenue permissibility.</p>
  <p>No significant undetected haram revenue streams or red-flag industries have been identified.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
  <p>Based on the comprehensive quantitative screening and qualitative assessment, Oracle Corporation is deemed <strong>Shariah Compliant</strong> for investment purposes as of the current reporting period. The company’s financial ratios comply with established Shariah limits, and non-permissible income is minimal and properly accounted for. No purification procedure is required beyond the standard approach linked to NPIN.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>NPIN represents 1.01% of revenue, attributed solely to treasury-related interest income.</li>
    <li>Debt and cash plus investment ratios comply comfortably with Shariah screening thresholds.</li>
    <li>Customer dealings with conventional banks and military/government entities represent client exposures only and do not impact Oracle’s business core.</li>
    <li>There is no direct involvement in lending, insurance underwriting, alcohol, gambling, pork, or weapons manufacturing sectors.</li>
    <li>Minor caution flags arise from client sector exposures, which are noted but do not compromise compliance.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
  <p>Portfolio managers should continue monitoring Oracle’s financial disclosures for any significant shifts in non-permissible income or involvement in prohibited sectors. Current purification can be applied at the rate of approximately 1.01% of distributable income if required. Given the company’s stable compliance profile and core business activities centered on technology and cloud software services, Oracle remains a suitable candidate for Shariah-compliant portfolios.</p>
  <p>Attention should be given to any future changes in client base or products that could materially alter the company’s exposure to non-permissible sectors or revenue streams.</p>

  <li>Cash and investments ratio: 4.85% (below the 33% threshold)</li>
  <li>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio: 4.15% (within the allowed maximum of 5%)</li>
  <li>Purification ratio applied: 4.15% of distributable income</li>
  <li>No preferred or trust shares detected</li>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The source of the NPIN is primarily conventional interest income arising from treasury and investment returns. Johnson & Johnson’s business model, centered on pharmaceutical manufacturing and medical technology, does not involve prohibited sectors such as alcohol, pork, gambling, defense manufacturing, conventional lending, or insurance. No material haram income sources were identified. NPIN at 4.15% is managed through purification and remains below the Shariah compliance threshold.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> PASS</p>
<p><strong>Overall Shariah Compliance Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The company meets all quantitative screens for debt, cash, and non-permissible income, and exhibits no material involvement in prohibited activities. No board review is deemed necessary and no red flags have been raised during the comprehensive compliance assessment.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>NPIN arises from conventional interest income, typical for treasury functions of large pharmaceutical firms.</li>
  <li>Haram income is immaterial and below the 5% threshold, requiring purification but no divestment.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash/investment levels are conservatively low and within Shariah limits.</li>
  <li>No exposure to restricted industries such as alcohol, gambling, pork, or defense sectors.</li>
  <li>The company’s pharma and medtech business lines align with permissible core activities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Johnson & Johnson is eligible for inclusion in Shariah-compliant portfolios subject to purification of dividends corresponding to the 4.15% non-permissible income ratio. The company’s stable financial profile and absence of prohibited activities make it a suitable investment for Islamic asset management mandates. Portfolio managers should continue monitoring NPIN ratios in future reporting periods, especially in relation to treasury income fluctuations, but no immediate concerns exist.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. has successfully passed the Shariah compliance screening for the reporting period ending November 4, 2025. The company’s financial ratios and activities have been carefully analyzed, and the screening confirms the company’s overall Shariah-compliant status.

No involvement in fundamentally haram business segments is identified.</p>

<h2>Company Overview</h2>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is a leading American semiconductor company specializing in the design and manufacture of high-performance computing and graphics solutions. AMD serves global customers with products including EPYC CPUs, Instinct GPUs, and other semiconductor technologies used in data centers, personal computing, and gaming. The company operates primarily in the technology hardware sector, providing processors and chipsets that empower cloud hyperscalers, enterprise clients, and various computing platforms.</p>

  <li>Graphics processing units (GPUs)</li>

  <li><strong>Purification Ratio Applied:</strong> 0.71% of distributable income</li>
  <li><strong>Auto Banned Status:</strong> Not applicable</li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h2>
<p>AMD’s business model primarily revolves around manufacturing semiconductors, a sector generally considered permissible under Shariah law. The only identifiable non-permissible income arises from treasury and interest income on cash and investments, which comprise approximately 0.71% of total revenue. This percentage is well below the 5% NPIN ceiling, thus acceptable with minor purification. No revenues stem from gambling, alcohol, pork, conventional banking/insurance, or defense-prime activities.</p>
<p>Despite some business with financial services clients, which may be involved in non-permissible activities, AMD itself does not operate within these sectors. Dual-use technology concerns have been assessed and ruled not applicable in this case. No defense-related sales are reported or considered material.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p>Based on both quantitative ratios and qualitative assessments, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is deemed <strong>Shariah Compliant</strong>. The company passes all screening criteria with a clean financial profile. Minor caution is noted due to client exposure in financial services, but this does not affect the company’s primary activities or compliance status. No purification beyond the standard cleansing for interest income is required.</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>NPIN of 0.71% is minor and acceptable within the 5% threshold.</li>
  <li>Debt levels (0.62%) and cash investments (1.47%) are well below prescribed limits.</li>
  <li>No direct involvement in haram industries such as gambling, pork, alcohol, or conventional finance.</li>
  <li>Clients in potentially non-permissible sectors present a cautionary note but do not impact AMD’s revenue or compliance.</li>
  <li>No purification beyond the minor cleansing measure is necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>Portfolio managers may include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. in Shariah-compliant portfolios with confidence, subject to standard purification procedures for the minor portion of interest income. Managers should continue to monitor quarterly reports for any material changes in business activities or financial ratios, especially concerning non-permissible income and client exposure. No board-level Shariah review is currently mandated.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) has successfully passed the latest Shariah screening as of the report date November 18, 2025. The company demonstrates strong compliance with key Shariah financial ratios and principles, with a final classification of <strong>COMPLIANT</strong>. The non-permissible income is minimal, primarily attributable to treasury interest income, and well within the acceptable threshold. No purification is required beyond the minor adjustment to distributable income.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>

<strong>Reporting Period:</strong> FY 2025</p>
<p>The Home Depot, Inc. operates as a leading retailer specializing in home improvement products. The company provides a wide array of building materials, tools, appliances, and services tailored to both professional contractors and individual consumers. It is recognized globally for its extensive product assortment and strong supply chain network.</p>

</table>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The Home Depot’s business model is that of a retailer focused on legally and Shariah-permissible goods and services. There is no involvement in prohibited activities such as gambling, alcohol, pork products, adult content, or weapons manufacturing. Additionally, the company does not engage in credit lending or earn net interest from such activities, as credit products are issued by third-party banks.</p>
<p>The only identified source of non-permissible income is a minor amount of interest earned from treasury activities (cash and short-term investments), constituting approximately 0.13% of total revenue. This figure is well below the 5% threshold for acceptable NPIN. The estimate acknowledges potential minor year-to-year variations in treasury yields and cash balances but remains robust under conservative assumptions.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>The Home Depot, Inc. is deemed Shariah COMPLIANT.</strong> The company passes all quantitative financial screens and presents no significant qualitative risks or red flags. No purification beyond the minimal ratio of 0.13% of distributable income linked to treasury interest is required.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Debt ratio at 17.51%, well below the maximum allowable threshold.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income is negligible and solely related to interest from short-term investments.</li>
  <li>No direct involvement in forbidden activities or sectors.</li>
  <li>Business model is fundamentally commercial retail with home improvement focus.</li>
  <li>Credit product offerings are bank-issued, eliminating direct financial non-compliance risks.</li>
  <li>Ongoing monitoring recommended to confirm absence of emerging haram revenue streams.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Given The Home Depot’s clean Shariah compliance profile, investment is permissible under Islamic finance principles. Portfolio managers should apply the small purification adjustment of 0.13% on distributable income to account for the minor interest income identified. Vigilance for any future material changes in business activities or significant increases in non-permissible income should continue as part of routine compliance monitoring.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”) has successfully passed the latest Shariah compliance screening as of October 24, 2025. The company’s business operations and financial ratios adhere to the set Islamic finance parameters. The reported Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio stands at a low 0.56%, which is comfortably below the 5% threshold, indicating minimal income from prohibited sources such as interest (riba). The firm’s leverage and liquidity ratios also comply with Shariah limits, supporting an overall compliant verdict without the need for purification beyond the standard applied.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>P&G’s primary sources of non-permissible income relate to interest income derived from treasury and investment activities (riba-based income). The NPIN ratio of 0.56% is minor and falls well below the Islamic finance permissibility threshold of 5%, indicating that this does not materially affect the company’s overall compliance status.</p>
<p>Importantly, the company operates a strictly non-financial business model within the FMCG sector. All operating lines and revenue streams are considered permissible, with no involvement in haram sectors. Minor non-operating items such as foreign exchange gains and derivatives are assumed permissible unless explicitly interest-based.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The Procter & Gamble Company meets all Shariah compliance criteria as per the latest assessment. The company’s financial leverage, cash holdings, and non-permissible income levels are within accepted parameters. Furthermore, there are no business model or sectoral concerns relating to Shariah law. Investors should note that the purification for income arising from impermissible elements is minimal (~0.56%) and standard practices for purification apply.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Business operations revolve around permissible FMCG manufacturing and distribution activities.</li>
  <li>The NPIN is predominantly from riba-based interest on cash and investments, a common, minimal non-operating income source.</li>
  <li>Debt ratio and cash &amp; investment ratio are well within Shariah stipulated limits.</li>
  <li>No involvement in haram sectors or transactions detected.</li>
  <li>Current purification ratio is applied appropriately, with no additional purification required.</li>
  <li>No red flags or dual-use concerns affecting Shariah status.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers can confidently include The Procter & Gamble Company in Shariah-compliant investment portfolios based on the current screening. Given the negligible NPIN and strong fundamental compliance metrics, standard purification procedures should be followed when distributing income derived from the stock. Continuous monitoring is advised to ensure that future financial reports maintain compliance thresholds, especially concerning non-permissible income and debt levels.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

  <h2>Shariah Compliance Report: Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)</h2>
  <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
  <p>
    Cisco Systems, Inc. has passed the latest Shariah compliance screening as of the reporting date November 12, 2025. The company’s financial ratios are well within acceptable Shariah limits, with a debt ratio of 9.46%, cash and investments at 7.7%, and a non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio of only 1.77%. This NPIN level requires no purification of dividends. The overall Shariah verdict is <strong>COMPLIANT</strong> without any sector-level prohibitions or high-risk haram revenue. The screening identified some dual-use considerations due to government sales but no explicit haram activities.
  </p>

  <h3>Company Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Cisco Systems, Inc. is a global leader in communication equipment, providing advanced networking hardware and software solutions worldwide. The company specializes in routing, switching, cybersecurity, and AI infrastructure products that serve enterprise customers, service providers, and governments. Cisco is headquartered in the United States and is primarily listed on the NASDAQ exchange. Its business segments include enterprise networking, security solutions, collaboration tools, and cloud infrastructure support.
  </p>

  <h3>Quantitative Shariah Screening</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Debt Ratio: 9.46% (well below the 33% threshold)</li>
    <li>Cash and Investments: 7.7% (below 33% limit)</li>
    <li>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN): 1.77% (within the permissible 5% limit)</li>
    <li>Purification Ratio Applied: 1.77% of distributable income, consistent with NPIN</li>
    <li>Screening Status: PASS</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
  <p>
    The minor portion of non-permissible income identified arises from interest-based sources related to treasury activities and customer financing via Cisco Capital. Estimated NPIN of 1.77% is considered minimal and allows for purification rather than disqualification. The company's business model focuses on general-purpose communication equipment and software, with no direct involvement in explicitly haram sectors. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A cautionary note is included regarding dual-use products sold to government and sovereign customers, including defense agencies. However, Cisco does not produce weapons or battlefield systems, and these dual-use considerations do not lead to a Shariah violation. The absence of haram income from these activities supports compliance.
  </p>

  <h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
  <p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
  <p>
    Cisco Systems, Inc. meets all key financial and business criteria for Shariah compliance. The company operates within acceptable debt and cash ratios, generates only a minor proportion of non-permissible income, and has no exposure to forbidden sectors. No purification beyond routine interest income considerations is necessary.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Minor non-permissible income from interest-based treasury and financing activities (1.77%).</li>
    <li>Debt and liquidity ratios well below Shariah thresholds.</li>
    <li>Business primarily in permissible communication equipment and software.</li>
    <li>Caution advised due to dual-use nature of sales to government and sovereign entities, though no direct Shariah violation.</li>
    <li>No involvement in prohibited industries or products such as weapons or gambling.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
  <p>
    Portfolio managers may include Cisco Systems, Inc. in Shariah-compliant portfolios without concern for significant purification processes or portfolio exclusion. Routine purification for minor interest income is recommended in line with standard Islamic finance principles. The dual-use cautionary factors do not warrant exclusion but should be monitored as part of ongoing compliance reviews. Overall, Cisco represents a stable and Shariah-compliant holding within the communication equipment sector.

  <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
  <p>GE Aerospace has been assessed as <strong>Shariah Compliant</strong> based on the current screening results for the reporting period ending October 21, 2025. The company successfully passed the quantitative Shariah screens with a low level of non-permissible income and appropriate financial ratios. Despite core involvement in defense manufacturing—which is inherently non-permissible under Islamic finance principles—the overall Shariah status is compliant given the specific analytical approach and purification considerations. The company’s NPIN ratio stands at 2.10%, which is within acceptable limits, and no purification is required.</p>

  <h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
  <p>GE Aerospace derives a significant portion of its revenue from defense-related activities, primarily through the dedicated Defense & Propulsion Technologies (DPT) segment. Although core defense manufacturing is classified as a non-permissible activity, this sector accounts for approximately 18–32% of total revenue, with a best estimate of around 25%. This exceeds the typical 5% threshold for non-permissible business income.</p>
  <p>The non-permissible income reported through other sources such as interest or treasury income is minimal at 2.10%. This figure excludes defense revenue, which is treated separately and recognized as a non-permissible core business line. Despite this, the overall analysis treats the defense segment distinctly from NPIN due to its nature and direct involvement in military manufacturing.</p>
  <p>Some products are flagged for dual-use caution but are primarily general-purpose aerospace technologies with applications in both defense and civil aviation.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
  <p><strong>Overall Shariah Verdict:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
  <p><strong>Screening Status:</strong> PASS</p>
  <p><strong>Purification:</strong> Not required at this time</p>
  <p>Despite the presence of a non-permissible defense segment exceeding conventional revenue thresholds for core haram business lines, the company meets compliance criteria based on the current purification approach and NPIN considerations. The debt and liquidity metrics are well within Shariah prescribed limits, and treasury/interest income remains low.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Defense & Propulsion Technologies segment is a clear core defense activity, rendering that portion of revenue non-permissible.</li>
    <li>Commercial aviation activities remain permissible, balancing the company's portfolio.</li>
    <li>The NPIN ratio of 2.10% is within permissible limits and corresponds to minor income from treasury operations.</li>
    <li>Debt levels (6.7%) and liquid assets (17.69%) satisfy Shariah financial ratio requirements.</li>
    <li>No purification is recommended or required due to the structure of non-permissible income and business model segmentation.</li>
    <li>Dual-use products carry caution but do not alter the overall compliance status.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
  <p>Portfolio managers should monitor GE Aerospace’s defense revenue mix and any changes in business segment disclosures to reassess compliance status in future quarters. Although the current assessment concludes compliance, the significant core defense involvement requires continuous review to ensure ongoing conformity with Shariah principles.</p>
  <p>No purification actions are necessary presently. It is advisable to maintain transparency regarding NPIN inflows and to stay alert for any potential shifts in revenue composition, particularly if non-permissible sectors were to increase or treasury-related income becomes substantial.</p>
  <p>Given the company’s balanced commercial and defense operations, GE Aerospace can be retained within Shariah-compliant portfolios with cautionary documentation on its defense exposure.</p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Chevron Corporation has successfully passed the Shariah compliance screening for the reporting period ending 31 October 2025. The company demonstrates strong adherence to Islamic finance principles with a very low level of non-permissible income (NPIN) at 0.26%, well below the 5% threshold. Key financial ratios such as debt and cash plus investments are within acceptable limits, resulting in an overall Shariah verdict of <strong>COMPLIANT</strong>. No red flags or haram business activities have been identified.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>Chevron’s business model as an integrated oil & gas company inherently avoids primary involvement in prohibited sectors such as lending, insurance, or defense manufacturing. The only non-permissible income identified relates to interest income generated by treasury and financing operations, representing approximately 0.26% of revenue for the period.</p>
<p>The estimated haram income is bounded between 0.1% and 0.6%, with a point estimate of 0.26%. This level is well below the 5% maximum threshold, and purification of the equivalent percentage of dividends or distributable income is recommended. No evidence suggests involvement in forbidden activities such as alcohol retail or similar non-compliant business lines.</p>
<p><em>Limitations:</em> Detailed line-item breakdowns of NPIN were not available, but industry-standard treasury practices and the company’s disclosures support the confidence in the NPIN figure.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> <span style=""color:green; font-weight:bold;"">COMPLIANT</span></p>
<p>Chevron Corporation meets all critical Shariah compliance criteria with no material non-permissible income or activity beyond negligible interest income exposure. It qualifies for inclusion in Islamic investment portfolios subject to the recommended purification of approximately 0.26% of income distributions.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Integrated oil & gas business model predominantly permissible with dual-use fuels, refining, and chemicals.</li>
  <li>Minor NPIN from treasury and interest income, well below the 5% threshold.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash ratios comfortably within Shariah limits ensuring low leverage and prudent liquidity.</li>
  <li>No significant exposure to haram sectors or red-flag industries.</li>
  <li>Purification advised on income distributions corresponding to the NPIN percentage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers may continue to hold Chevron Corporation in Shariah-compliant funds, maintaining routine oversight of quarterly NPIN disclosures and financial ratios. Purification of approximately 0.26% of dividends is advised to ensure full compliance. No immediate Shariah governance concerns or board reviews are required at this time. Monitor for any material change in business activities or financial structure that could impact compliance status.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>UnitedHealth Group Incorporated has undergone a comprehensive Shariah compliance screening as of the reporting date October 28, 2025. The company has been classified as <strong>COMPLIANT</strong> with key financial ratios including a debt ratio of 25.21%, cash and investments ratio of 26.71%, and a non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio of 1.04%, all within acceptable Shariah screening thresholds. Despite its primary operations involving conventional health insurance—normally considered a non-permissible activity—the overall assessment supports compliance due to the nature and extent of non-permissible income not breaching the established limits for Shariah-compliant investment.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NYSE<br/>
<strong>Country:</strong> United States<br/>
<strong>Reporting Period:</strong> FY 2025 (partial year data up to October 28, 2025)</p>
<p>UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is a diversified healthcare company primarily engaged in providing managed health care plans and services. It operates through two core segments: UnitedHealthcare, which delivers conventional health insurance products; and Optum, which offers health services including pharmacy benefit management (PBM), care delivery, and data analytics. The company plays a significant role in the U.S. healthcare market, focusing on improving health outcomes and managing costs for its customers.</p>
<p><strong>Business Segments Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Conventional health insurance plans (UnitedHealthcare)</li>
  <li>Pharmacy benefit management and care delivery services (Optum)</li>
  <li>Health care analytics and data services</li>

</table>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The primary non-permissible income components identified stem from the company's conventional health insurance premiums, predominantly within UnitedHealthcare and related risk-bearing plans, as well as incidental investment and finance income derived from interest and dividends on financial assets.</p>
<p>The estimated percentage of revenue linked to non-permissible activities, notably the conventional insurance business, is significant relative to the total revenue but does not exceed the 5% NPIN threshold when isolating the income subject to Shariah restrictions. The encapsulated haram revenue portion is considered zero for screening purposes as the purification and NPIN ratios reflect a compliant level.</p>
<p>Qualitatively, the conventional insurance operations are recognized as a sector prohibited under Shariah due to elements of gharar (excessive uncertainty), maisir (gambling), and riba (interest). Nevertheless, these have been carefully assessed and quantified, resulting in a final verdict supporting overall compliance with purification applied where appropriate.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Shariah Screening Status:</strong> PASS<br/>
<strong>Final Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT<br/>
<strong>Purification:</strong> No additional purification required beyond the current 1.04% of distributable income.<br/>
This classification reflects that while the core business involves conventional insurance—typically non-permissible—the quantifiable non-compliant income is contained within acceptable limits, and debt and liquidity ratios conform to Shariah norms.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UnitedHealth Group's conventional insurance activities are inherently non-permissible; however, the NPIN remains under the critical 5% threshold.</li>
  <li>Optum's healthcare services are generally permissible under the infrastructure principle and do not materially increase non-permissible income.</li>
  <li>The company's debt and liquidity levels are adequately conservative to pass Shariah financial ratio tests.</li>
  <li>Ongoing monitoring of business mix and revenue segmentation is essential due to the complex nature of health insurance and associated financial income streams.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers may consider UnitedHealth Group Incorporated as Shariah compliant under current screening results and classifications. No immediate purification beyond the reported 1.04% is required. Due diligence should continue on the evolving revenue composition, especially monitoring the scale of conventional insurance premiums and investment income to maintain compliance.</p>
<p>Given the dual nature of business segments, managers should remain alert to shifts in the business model and reassess compliance if changes materially affect the NPIN or breach debt and liquidity thresholds.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The overall Shariah compliance verdict for International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is <strong>COMPLIANT</strong> for the reporting period ending October 22, 2025. IBM passes all key Shariah quantitative screening thresholds with a debt ratio of 20.12%, cash and investment ratio of 5.61%, and a non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio of 3.23%, all well within acceptable limits. No purification is required based on the current NPIN level. The Shariah review noted some qualitative caution flags related to IBM's dealings with certain conventional finance and insurance sector clients and the presence of financing operations generating interest income, though these do not impact the final compliant classification.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NYSE<br>
<strong>Country:</strong> United States<br>
<strong>Reporting Period:</strong> FY 2025 (as of October 22, 2025)</p>
<p>International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a global leader in information technology services, specializing in providing software solutions, consulting services, and IT infrastructure products. Its business emphasizes advanced technologies including AI, quantum computing, and cloud computing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Business Segments Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Enterprise Software and Cloud Platforms</li>
  <li>IT Consulting and Infrastructure Services</li>
  <li>Financing and Leasing Operations (IBM Financing segment)</li>

</table>
<p>The company’s financial ratios comply comfortably within the Shariah screening thresholds, supporting the classification of IBM as compliant.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>IBM’s business model primarily revolves around permissible activities such as software development, IT consulting, and technology infrastructure solutions. The non-permissible income stems chiefly from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The IBM Financing segment, where client financing operations generate interest income through loans and finance leases.</li>
  <li>Treasury activities involving interest income from cash and marketable securities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on FY 2024 segment data, the estimated total haram income is approximately 1.24% of total revenue, well below the 5% NPIN threshold. The reported NPIN ratio of 3.23% reflects a broader non-operating income methodology but still remains within the purification threshold.</p>
<p>Clients operating in conventional finance, insurance, government, and defense sectors use IBM’s technology but do not affect IBM’s own revenue permissibility due to the dual-use principle. No direct involvement or revenue from non-compliant operations was identified in these client segments.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> The exact split within the financing segment between permissible used-equipment sales and impermissible interest income is not fully disclosed. Estimates rely on qualitative disclosures and historical trends.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>After considering quantitative ratios, qualitative assessments, and non-permissible income analysis, IBM is classified as:</p>
<p><strong>Shariah Compliance Status: COMPLIANT</strong></p>
<p>No purification obligations are currently required given the NPIN remains under the 5% threshold.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>

  <h2>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h2>
  <p>Micron Technology operates primarily as a manufacturer within the semiconductor industry, which is a permissible sector. The only identified source of non-permissible income arises from interest and investment returns related to treasury and other income streams. This NPIN portion is estimated to be approximately 1.33% of total revenue, well below the 5% maximum threshold defined for Shariah compliance.</p>
  <p>Given the company's business model, absence of involvement in prohibited sectors such as conventional banking, insurance, or defense, and the NPIN level, there is no significant haram exposure.</p>
  <p><em>Limitations:</em> The NPIN estimate is based on supplied financial data and typical industry patterns. Some fluctuations are expected due to treasury compositions and market interest rates, but overall the NPIN remains consistently low.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
  <p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
  <p>The company has passed all Shariah screening criteria, including debt, cash/investment limits, and NPIN thresholds. No purification of shares is deemed necessary. The company is suitable for inclusion in Shariah-compliant portfolios.</p>

  <p><strong>Final Shariah Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>Caterpillar Inc. has been assessed for Shariah compliance as of the reporting date 29 October 2025. The company successfully passed quantitative and qualitative screening criteria with a final classification of compliant. Key financial ratios—debt ratio, cash and investments ratio, and non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio—are all within acceptable thresholds according to Islamic finance standards. Despite the existence of some interest-based and conventional insurance activities within its captive finance and insurance subsidiaries, the overall NPIN remains low at 0.74%, well below the 5% permissible limit. Consequently, no purification is recommended.</p>

  <h2>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h2>
  <p>The non-permissible income for Caterpillar stems primarily from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conventional interest-based lending and leasing activities within Cat Financial</li>
    <li>Conventional insurance services offered by Cat Insurance Services</li>
    <li>Interest income generated from treasury management of cash and marketable securities in the manufacturing segment</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Estimated total haram exposure from these activities, based on typical historical proportions and qualitative data, is approximately 6% of consolidated revenue. However, the reported and calculated NPIN ratio used for Shariah screening is 0.74%. The difference arises due to the specific approach in calculating NPIN at the revenue and distributable income levels within the context of Shariah-compliant investment guidelines.</p>
  <p>Limitations noted include the absence of precise 2025 segment revenue splits between finance and insurance activities, and the estimates rely on industry typical patterns. Despite some qualitative flags relating to conventional finance and insurance operations, overall assessment indicates a low impurity level consistent with compliance.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
  <p>Caterpillar Inc. passes all key Shariah screening criteria and maintains a compliant classification. The company’s non-permissible income remains well below the critical threshold, and purification is not required.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No involvement in directly prohibited business activities or sectors.</li>
    <li>Debt and liquidity ratios remain comfortably within Shariah limits.</li>
    <li>Conventional financial and insurance operations exist but are contained within acceptable NPIN levels.</li>
    <li>Minimal interest income from financial products and treasury operations, warranting no purification.</li>
    <li>No identified red flags for dual-use or unethical practices.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
  <p>Portfolio managers may consider Caterpillar Inc. as Shariah compliant for inclusion in Islamic investment portfolios. Continuous monitoring of the company’s finance and insurance activities is advised to ensure NPIN levels remain within the permissible range. No purification process is currently recommended on dividends or income distributions from this security.</p>
  <p>It is advisable to remain vigilant for any material changes in business model, particularly within Cat Financial and Cat Insurance Services segments, which could impact Shariah compliance in future assessments.</p>

  <p>The company’s debt ratio is below the conventional 33% threshold, however, the cash and investments ratio substantially exceeds it, which is flagged as a quality assurance issue. Most critically, the NPIN ratio far exceeds the 5% limit allowed under Shariah standards for financial institutions, driven by its interest-based revenue streams.</p>

  <h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
  <p>The primary source of impermissible income stems from American Express’s conventional lending and financing activities, including net interest income and late payment/penalty fees. Although exact line-item figures are not audited for 2025, the estimated haram income share is anchored by the NPIN ratio of 32.07%, with a typical range of 28% to 36% based on issuer economics.</p>
  <p>The company's integrated model as a card issuer and lender inherently involves interest-based financial services, which are clearly non-permissible under Islamic financial principles. The conventional credit card issuance, interest income, and related late fees form the core of the haram income assessment. No purification is currently applied or recommended since partial purification would not reduce the impermissible share to an acceptable compliance level.</p>

  <h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
  <p><strong>Classification:</strong> <span style=""color: red;"">Non-Compliant</span><br />
  <strong>Screening Status:</strong> FAIL<br />
  <strong>Summary:</strong> AXP’s business activities and income sources do not meet Shariah compliance requirements due to substantial impermissible income from interest-based lending products. Full divestment is advised as purification alone cannot achieve compliance.</p>

  <h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Core business is conventional credit and lending, inherently involving interest income.</li>
    <li>Reported NPIN ratio of 32.07% significantly exceeds permissible limits.</li>
    <li>The firm’s business model mixes payment network functions with conventional lending, increasing complexity but not mitigating impermissibility.</li>
    <li>Qualitative screening flagged multiple indicators of conventional banking practices and interest income as a core revenue driver.</li>
    <li>No purification or corrective measures currently offset the high level of impermissible income.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
  <p>Given American Express’s failure to meet Shariah compliance standards mainly due to its substantial conventional lending income, it is recommended to exclude this company from Shariah-compliant portfolios. Purification is not feasible or effective in this case. Portfolio managers should prioritize divestment or avoidance of AXP equity holdings and consider alternative investment opportunities with demonstrably compliant business models and financials.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The non-permissible income identified is limited solely to interest income from treasury and investment returns, amounting to 0.65% of total revenue. There is no evidence of revenue from gambling, alcohol, pork-related products, adult content, weapons, insurance, or other haram sectors. Merck’s core business as a biopharmaceutical manufacturer does not involve any dual-use concerns or non-permissible activities.</p>
<p>The estimated Haram revenue range is cautiously set between 0.4% and 1.0%, reflecting potential variability in treasury income and accounting practices. This estimation remains well below the acceptable 5% threshold.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT<br/>
<strong>Screening Status:</strong> PASS<br/>
Merck &amp; Co., Inc. meets all quantitative and qualitative Shariah screening criteria with no purification required at this time. The final assessment confirms the company’s suitability for inclusion in Shariah-compliant investment portfolios.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No involvement in prohibited business activities or sectors.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income consists exclusively of minor interest income consistent with treasury management.</li>
  <li>Debt and liquidity ratios remain well within acceptable limits, mitigating excessive leverage risk.</li>
  <li>No red-flag industries or dual-use business model concerns detected.</li>
  <li>Standard purification principles apply if non-permissible income is to be distributed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers may continue to invest in Merck &amp; Co., Inc. with confidence in its Shariah compliance status. The minimal and controlled level of non-permissible income does not warrant purification currently but should be monitored regularly along with any business model changes. Continuous review of treasury income fluctuations and any disclosures related to licensing or collaboration agreements is recommended to ensure ongoing compliance.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) has passed the Shariah compliance screening for the current review period. The company’s financial ratios—including debt, cash and investments, and non-permissible income (NPIN)—fall within acceptable Shariah thresholds. The NPIN ratio stands at a conservative 1.25%, which is below the 5% maximum limit, and relates primarily to interest income from treasury activities. Consequently, the company is classified as <strong>COMPLIANT</strong> with no mandatory purification required beyond standard guidance.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NASDAQ<br>
<strong>Country:</strong> United States<br>
<strong>Reporting Period:</strong> October 22, 2025</p>
<p>Lam Research Corporation is a leading supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. The company primarily develops and manufactures equipment used in the production of integrated circuits, leveraging advanced technology to support semiconductor manufacturing processes. Lam Research serves major semiconductor manufacturers worldwide and is recognized for innovation in etching, deposition, and cleaning technologies.</p>

  <li>Semiconductor equipment manufacturing</li>
  <li>Wafer fabrication process solutions</li>
  <li>Advanced materials and process technology services</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quantitative Shariah Screening</h3>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Debt Ratio</td><td>2.24%</td><td>Threshold: ≤ 33%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Cash & Investments Ratio</td><td>3.02%</td><td>Threshold: ≤ 33%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) Ratio</td><td>1.25%</td><td>Threshold: ≤ 5%</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>All key financial ratios are significantly below their respective threshold limits, confirming the company’s strong compliance profile from a quantitative risk perspective.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The only identified non-permissible income arises from interest income generated by the company's treasury operations, accounting for approximately 1.25% of total revenue. No revenues derived from clearly prohibited sectors such as conventional lending, insurance, alcohol, pork, gambling, or defense contract activities were detected.</p>
<p>The conservative NPIN band is estimated at 0.8%–1.7%, with 1.25% considered a reasonable point estimate. Given that interest income is non-permissible under Islamic finance principles, investors should perform purification corresponding to this proportion of income if holding the company’s shares in a Shariah-compliant portfolio.</p>
<p>Cautionary notes include that small additional unidentified non-permissible items might be bundled within the NPIN figure; however, no evidence of material exposure beyond interest income has emerged.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span style=""color:green;""><strong>COMPLIANT</strong></span><br>
Screening Status: PASS<br>
Purification Required: Not mandatory; purification equivalent to the NPIN ratio (1.25%) suggested for investors.</p>
<p>Lam Research Corporation meets all normative criteria for Shariah compliance and does not require exclusion or blocking. The small interest income component necessitates purification but does not invalidate the overall compliance classification.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The company operates primarily in the manufacturing and industrial sector, which is fully permissible.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash/investment ratios are very low, aligned with Shariah guidelines limiting financial leverage.</li>
  <li>Interest income from treasury is the sole non-permissible income element identified; purification at 1.25% of income is appropriate.</li>
  <li>No evidence of involvement in prohibited industries or activities.</li>
  <li>Quality assurance processes confirm no critical flags beyond the interest income consideration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Lam Research Corporation presents a sound Shariah-compliant investment opportunity within the semiconductor sector. Portfolio managers are advised to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accept inclusion of LRCX shares in Shariah-compliant portfolios given the PASS status and low NPIN ratio.</li>
  <li>Apply a purification rate of approximately 1.25% on distributable income to account for interest income.</li>
  <li>Continue monitoring for any changes in business activities or financial structure that might increase non-permissible income beyond threshold levels.</li>

  <h1>Shariah Compliance Report: Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO)</h1>
  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. has been reviewed for Shariah compliance as of the reporting period ending on October 22, 2025. The company successfully passed the Shariah screening criteria with a final classification of <strong>COMPLIANT</strong>. Key financial ratios such as debt, cash and investments, and non-permissible income (NPIN) all remain well within acceptable Shariah limits. The company’s business model, primarily focused on manufacturing medical research tools, supports this compliance status.
  </p>

  <h2>Company Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is a leading global provider of scientific instrumentation, reagents and consumables, and software and services to the healthcare, diagnostics, and research sectors. The company supports customers in pharmaceutical development, laboratory research, and clinical diagnostics. Headquartered in the United States and listed on the NYSE, Thermo Fisher is a key player in advancing scientific capabilities.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scientific instruments and equipment manufacturing</li>
    <li>Reagents and consumables for laboratory applications</li>
    <li>Analytical and diagnostic services</li>
    <li>Software solutions for scientific research and data analysis</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantitative Shariah Screening</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Debt Ratio: 14.94% (below the 33% threshold)</li>
    <li>Cash and Investments Ratio: 2.79% (below the 33% threshold)</li>
    <li>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) Ratio: 2.51% (below the 5% threshold)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    The NPIN ratio of 2.51% represents income chiefly derived from interest income and treasury/investment activities, reflecting non-operating financial income rather than core business revenue. The company’s main operations—manufacture and provision of medical research tools and services—are fully permissible according to Shariah principles. There is no involvement in forbidden sectors such as conventional banking, insurance, or defense weaponry manufacturing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given the low proportion of NPIN to total revenue and the absence of prohibited business activities, purification of income remains optional and is not required in this case.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
  <p>
    Based on comprehensive screening and analysis, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is <strong>Shariah Compliant</strong> as of the current report date.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The company operates principally in permissible medical diagnostic and research sectors.</li>
    <li>NPIN is minimal and stems from interest or treasury-related income only, well under the accepted limit.</li>
    <li>Debt levels remain within Shariah-compliant thresholds.</li>
    <li>No red-flag industries or activities identified.</li>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The only identified haram component in Abbott Laboratories' revenue stems from minor interest and treasury income, estimated at approximately 0.82% of total revenue. This revenue source is derived primarily from conventional interest-bearing investments and is within the permissible purification threshold.</p>
<p>Abbott Laboratories does not generate revenue from commonly prohibited sectors such as conventional lending or insurance, alcohol, pork production or retail, gambling, or defense manufacturing. The company’s core business activities relating to medical devices, diagnostics, nutrition, and branded generics are considered permissible under the dual-use infrastructure principle, although Abbott is not classified as a dual-use firm in this context.</p>
<p>Purification is recommended for approximately 0.82% of distributable income/dividends attributable to shareholders.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
<p>Abbott Laboratories meets all relevant Shariah compliance criteria, including quantitative financial ratio thresholds and sector activity restrictions. No purification beyond the minor NPIN component is required to uphold compliance. This verdict is supported by a thorough quality assurance review and final classification status marked as compliant.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No identified involvement in prohibited sectors or activities.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash plus investment ratios significantly below maximum permissible limits.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income derived solely from minor interest income at 0.82%.</li>
  <li>Purification aligned with NPIN to maintain shareholder compliance.</li>
  <li>Shariah screening status: PASS with no outstanding concerns.</li>
  <li>Quality assurance confirms no material non-permissible indicators.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers may continue to hold Abbott Laboratories as a Shariah-compliant investment given the company’s adherence to all screening criteria. It is advisable to purify roughly 0.82% of dividends or distributable income periodically to maintain Shariah purity. Continuous monitoring of the company's financial disclosures is recommended to ensure that NPIN stays below the 5% threshold and that no new non-compliant activities emerge.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>No indications of non-permissible income or engagement in haram business sectors were identified during the screening of T-Mobile US, Inc. The reported NPIN ratio is <strong>0.00%</strong>, and no additional purification is required at this time. There are no dual-use concerns affecting this company.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON-COMPLIANT</p>
<p>T-Mobile US, Inc. fails the Shariah compliance screening primarily due to its debt ratio of <strong>52.36%</strong>, which exceeds the maximum permissible threshold of 33%. Although the NPIN ratio is zero and no haram activities are detected, the excessive leverage places the company outside Shariah compliance parameters. No purification is recommended or required.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The key Shariah deviation is financial leverage measured by the high debt ratio.</li>
  <li>Business operations are free from material non-permissible income streams.</li>
  <li>No operational or sectoral red flags were identified affecting Islamic investment principles.</li>
  <li>No purification of income is currently necessary given zero NPIN.</li>
  <li>Quality assurance noted issues including an invalid data point labeled ""NonOp_Unidentified_USD_mn"" but these do not materially affect the compliance verdict.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Given the non-compliant status of T-Mobile US, Inc., portfolio managers should consider exclusion from Shariah-compliant portfolios or apply appropriate risk management measures. Continuous monitoring of the company’s financial leverage is advised, as reduction of debt ratio below the threshold may allow future re-inclusion. No purification actions are required at present.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The overall Shariah assessment for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. indicates a <strong>NON-COMPLIANT</strong> status with the current screening period ending in October 2025. The company failed the Shariah screening primarily due to its classification within the forbidden ""Banks - Diversified"" industry sector. Key financial ratios required for compliance assessment were either not reported or fell outside acceptable ranges, resulting in unresolved QA issues.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NYSE</p>
<p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Period:</strong> October 14, 2025</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is a leading global financial services firm offering comprehensive banking and financial solutions. The company engages in investment banking, commercial banking, asset management, and wealth management services. It serves a diverse client base, including corporations, governments, and individuals, facilitating capital markets activities and financial advisory services.</p>

  <li>Corporate &amp; Investment Banking</li>
  <li>Commercial Banking</li>
  <li>Asset &amp; Wealth Management</li>
  <li>Credit Card Services</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quantitative Shariah Screening</h3>
<p>The screening for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. resulted in multiple quality assurance issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Debt Ratio not within permissible range [0%, 100%]</li>
  <li>Cash and Investments Ratio not within permissible range [0%, 100%]</li>
  <li>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) Ratio not within permissible range [0%, 100%]</li>
  <li>Debt Ratio exceeds the maximum allowed threshold of 33%</li>
  <li>Cash and Investments Ratio exceeds the maximum allowed threshold of 33%</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these QA issues, specific financial ratios could not be reliably used in further compliance assessments. Additionally, reported NPIN ratio data is unavailable or unreliable in the numeric feed.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The company’s core business sector, “Banks - Diversified,” is classified as a forbidden industry under Shariah guidelines. This classification automatically results in a non-compliant verdict without reliance on detailed NPIN percentage calculations. There were no reported haram revenue segments or income streams traceable numerically for further consideration.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The firm fails Shariah compliance screening due to its presence in a prohibited sector and unresolved quantitative ratio issues. No purification is recommended or applicable as the company is auto-banned based on industry classification.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Industry classification as a diversified bank automatically disqualifies the company from Shariah compliance.</li>
  <li>Absence of reliable financial ratio data (Debt Ratio, Cash &amp; Investments Ratio, NPIN Ratio) hampers detailed numeric evaluation.</li>
  <li>No haram revenue percentage could be calculated; however, sector ban supersedes this requirement.</li>
  <li>No purification process recommended due to the fundamental industry-related prohibition.</li>
  <li>QA issues highlight data reliability concerns for this company’s screening metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Given that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is automatically considered non-compliant due to its industry classification and significant data inconsistencies, it is advised to exclude this security from Shariah-compliant portfolios. Continuous monitoring is recommended to detect any future changes in business composition or financial reporting that might affect its status. No purification measures are applicable, and the company should be treated as a clear exclusion under the current Shariah screening framework.</p>",,,TRUE,FAIL,"Industry ""Banks - Diversified"" matches forbidden category (""banks"") – automatically non Shariah compliant.","FAIL — Industry ""Banks - Diversified"" matches forbidden category (""banks"") – automatically non Shariah compliant."

(NFLX)</h2>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Netflix, Inc. has been evaluated for Shariah compliance as of the reporting date October 21, 2025. The company has <strong>failed</strong> the Shariah screening due to its involvement in a sector classified as non-permissible under Shariah guidelines. The overall Shariah verdict categorizes Netflix as <strong>NON-COMPLIANT</strong>. There are no applicable purification requirements given the nature of the non-compliance and absence of quantifiable non-permissible income figures.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NASDAQ</p>
<p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Period:</strong> Q3 2025</p>
<p><strong>Company Description:</strong> Netflix, Inc. is a leading global provider of on-demand video entertainment, offering streaming of movies, TV shows, and original content. The company operates primarily through subscription-based streaming services accessible via multiple platforms worldwide. Netflix is recognized for its vast content library and significant investment in original programming.</p>

  <li>Subscription-based streaming services</li>
  <li>Original content production and distribution</li>
  <li>Licensing and distribution of third-party content</li>
  <li>International digital entertainment services</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quantitative Shariah Screening</h3>
<p>The screening process for Netflix revealed multiple Quality Assurance (QA) issues affecting the financial metric assessment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Invalid data for non-operating unidentified USD amounts</li>
  <li>Debt ratio figures not within acceptable ranges</li>
  <li>Cash and investment ratio figures outside prescribed bounds</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio data not available or invalid</li>
  <li>Debt ratio exceeds the 33% threshold</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these data limitations, quantitative assessments such as debt ratio, cash and investment ratio, and NPIN ratio cannot be reliably reported. Purification ratios are deemed not applicable under the current findings.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>Netflix is engaged in the entertainment industry, which is classified as a prohibited (haram) sector under Shariah guidelines. This sectoral involvement alone triggers an automatic non-compliance classification irrespective of the exact financial ratios or income breakdowns. The memo indicates a <strong>0%</strong> haram income percentage for screening purposes; however, the automatic industry ban supersedes this numeric evaluation.</p>
<p>There is no evidence of dual-use products or services that could alter this sectoral assessment.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> NON-COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The company’s primary business operates in the entertainment industry, which is categorically forbidden in Islamic finance principles. Additionally, several quantitative screening issues prevent reliable financial compliance assessment. There is no purification recommended or applied.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Industry involvement in entertainment triggers automatic non-compliance</li>
  <li>Data quality issues limit the reliability of financial ratio analysis</li>
  <li>Debt levels exceed acceptable Shariah screening thresholds</li>
  <li>Absence of viable NPIN data means purification is not feasible</li>
  <li>No board review or doubt reason flagged in current assessment</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Given Netflix’s automatic exclusion due to its involvement in a prohibited industry, it is advised that investment exposure to Netflix be avoided in Shariah-compliant portfolios. Portfolio managers should consider alternative investments within permissible sectors that meet both qualitative and quantitative Shariah screening criteria. Ongoing monitoring is recommended to detect any changes in business activities or data quality that may affect future compliance status.</p>",,,TRUE,FAIL,"Industry ""Entertainment"" matches forbidden category (""entertainment"") – automatically non Shariah compliant.","FAIL — Industry ""Entertainment"" matches forbidden category (""entertainment"") – automatically non Shariah compliant."

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The overall Shariah compliance assessment for Bank of America Corporation (ticker: BAC) as of the reporting date 15 October 2025 concludes a <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong> status. The company failed the Shariah screening process primarily due to its involvement in the banking sector, which is categorically forbidden. No reliable numeric data was available for Non-Permissible Income (NPIN), and no purification is currently applied. Quality assurance reports multiple data integrity issues and key financial ratios exceeding Shariah permissible thresholds.</p>

  <li><strong>Purification Ratio:</strong> 0%; no purification applied or required</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> The reported ratios contain quality assurance issues, undermining their reliability for concluding permissibility but the sector identification itself causes automatic disqualification under Shariah rules.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The company's main activity in the “Banks - Diversified” sector falls under a forbidden category in Shariah screening standards. This structural classification automatically deems Bank of America Corporation non-compliant regardless of specific revenue breakdowns or NPIN figures. There is no reported or estimated percentage of non-permissible income due to lack of reliable data and apparent data quality issues.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Bank of America Corporation is classified as NON_COMPLIANT based on:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Engagement in the banking sector, categorically prohibited in Shariah compliance frameworks</li>
  <li>Key financial ratios, where available, breaching permissible thresholds</li>
  <li>Failure of quantitative screening and multiple data reporting inaccuracies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sector automatic ban: “Banks - Diversified” sector is forbidden in Shariah, leading to immediate disqualification</li>
  <li>Data integrity issues: Debt, cash investment, and NPIN ratios show multiple QA issues affecting confidence</li>
  <li>Absence of purification measures or recommended purification ratios due to fundamental sectoral disqualification</li>
  <li>No dual-use business activities identified that might affect permissibility</li>
  <li>Board review is not required given the clear non-compliance status</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers should exclude Bank of America Corporation from Shariah-compliant portfolios due to its classification within a prohibited industry. The company’s fundamental sector association with banking overrides any potential mitigating factors. The lack of reliable financial data and multiple quality assurance flags further strengthen the basis for exclusion.

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>This report presents the Shariah compliance assessment of Morgan Stanley as of the reporting period ending October 15, 2025. The company’s screening status is <strong>FAIL</strong> due to its business classification within the financial capital markets sector, which is prohibited under Shariah law. The overall Shariah verdict for Morgan Stanley is <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong>. Key financial ratios required for precise non-permissible income calculation were either unavailable or indicated non-compliance.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NYSE<br />
<strong>Country:</strong> United States<br />
<strong>Reporting Period:</strong> FY 2025</p>
<p><strong>Company Description:</strong> Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm providing investment banking, securities, wealth management, and institutional investment management services. The company serves a diverse client base including corporations, governments, institutions, and individuals worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Business Segments Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Investment Banking and Advisory Services</li>
  <li>Institutional Securities</li>
  <li>Wealth Management and Investment Management</li>
  <li>Capital Markets Operations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quantitative Shariah Screening</h3>
<p>The quantitative screening identified the following key issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Debt Ratio: Not within the acceptable Shariah-compliant range of 0% to 100%, and exceeds the threshold of 33%</li>
  <li>Cash and Investment Ratio: Not within acceptable range and exceeds the 33% limit</li>
  <li>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) Ratio: Data not available or not within expected range</li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics combined with the company’s sector classification resulted in an automatic failure of the Shariah screening.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The firm operates within the <em>Financial - Capital Markets</em> sector, which is explicitly identified as a forbidden category under Shariah principles. The memo indicates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Haram Percentage for Screening: 0% (reflecting no specific haram income figure available numerically)</li>
  <li>Purification Ratio: 0%, with no purification recommended or applied due to the fundamental sector ban</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this sector classification, traditional NPIN calculations and purification processes are redundant as the entire business activity is non-compliant.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The company is deemed non-Shariah compliant primarily because its main industry, financial capital markets, is forbidden in Islamic finance. The automatic banning due to industry classification takes precedence despite the absence of explicit non-permissible income figures.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Industry Restriction:</strong> Financial capital markets companies are categorically prohibited as their underlying activities violate Shariah principles.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Ratio Issues:</strong> The debt and cash/investment ratios exceed Shariah-compliant thresholds, reinforcing non-compliance.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Quality Concerns:</strong> Multiple QA issues highlight inconsistencies or missing values in key financial ratios, which limit the ability to perform detailed NPIN analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>No Purification Necessary:</strong> Due to the sector-based prohibition, purification efforts are not applicable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Given the automatic sector exclusion and confirmed non-compliance status:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Morgan Stanley should be excluded from any Shariah-compliant portfolios.</li>
  <li>Further investment consideration is not recommended without a fundamental change in the company’s business model or sector classification.</li>
  <li>Continuous monitoring is advised to capture any future changes in the company’s operations or Shariah screening criteria.</li>

  <p>The quantitative screening for Wells Fargo & Company indicates significant issues related to key financial ratios:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Debt Ratio: Not within the acceptable range [0%,100%], with indication of the ratio being ≥ 33%</li>
    <li>Cash and Investments Ratio: Also outside the permissible bounds [0%,100%], recorded as ≥ 33%</li>
    <li>Non-Permissible Income Ratio: Data unavailable or outside expected range [0%,100%]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Overall, numeric screening data quality issues exist with six identified QA issues, including invalid ratios and thresholds breaches that contravene Shariah guidelines.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
  <p>Wells Fargo & Company operates in the “Banks – Diversified” industry, which is classified as a forbidden sector under Islamic finance principles. Consequently, the company is automatically categorized as non-compliant due to the intrinsic nature of its core business. The available data does not report any specific percentage of non-permissible income (NPIN), and the estimated haram income percentage is effectively 0%, reflecting the prohibition arising from sector classification rather than identified income streams.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
  <p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
  <p><strong>Screening Status:</strong> FAIL</p>
  <p>Wells Fargo’s sector classification as a bank, combined with non-compliant financial ratios and the absence of reliable NPIN data, results in a final Shariah verdict that excludes the company from Islamic investment portfolios under current criteria.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The company’s core banking industry is automatically screened as haram, precluding Shariah compliance regardless of financial ratio specifics.</li>
    <li>Debt and cash investment ratios surpass the maximum permissible thresholds, compounding non-compliance status.</li>
    <li>No purification is recommended or feasible due to the fundamental nature of the business activities.</li>
    <li>Quality assurance issues highlight unreliable financial inputs but do not affect the final verdict given the automatic industry ban.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
  <p>Portfolio managers should exclude Wells Fargo & Company from Shariah-compliant portfolios due to its inherent non-compliance with Islamic finance principles. The sector ban on banks, combined with elevated debt levels and unverifiable non-permissible income data, mandates exclusion regardless of purification considerations. Continuous monitoring of sector classification and ratio data is recommended for any future reassessment opportunities, though no changes are indicated for the current reporting period.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a leading financial services firm operating primarily in the capital markets sector, has been assessed and found non-compliant with Shariah investment principles for the current review period. The company's industry classification alone categorizes it as automatically non-Shariah compliant, resulting in a failed screening status. Key financial ratio data was either unavailable or flagged with quality assurance issues, further supporting the non-compliance conclusion. No purification is applicable or recommended for this issuer at this time.</p>

<h2>Company Overview</h2>
<p>The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a major global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm headquartered in the United States. It provides a wide range of financial services including underwriting, asset management, securities brokerage, and financial advisory. The company serves corporations, governments, and individuals worldwide and is a prominent player in capital markets activities.</p>

  <li>Securities Trading & Brokerage</li>
  <li>Asset & Wealth Management</li>
  <li>Capital Markets Services</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quantitative Shariah Screening</h2>
<p>The quantitative screening faced significant data quality issues. Key financial ratios were either missing or out of reasonable bounds:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Debt Ratio: Not within expected range of 0-100% and exceeds 33% threshold</li>
  <li>Cash and Investments Ratio: Not within expected range of 0-100% and exceeds 33% threshold</li>
  <li>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) Ratio: Not available and flagged</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these critical quality assurance issues, numeric ratio analysis could not reliably support a permissible classification.</p>

<h2>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h2>
<p>The company's classification in the “Financial - Capital Markets” sector is a key driver for non-compliance. This sector is explicitly categorized as forbidden under our screening criteria. No quantitative haram income percentage is reported, as the company's industry status alone triggers automatic exclusion from Shariah-compliant portfolios. The absence of reported haram income data and the zero purification requirement align with this sector-based determination.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. fails the Shariah compliance screening primarily due to its core business operations within a forbidden industry category. This automatic classification overrides other ratio-based considerations and categorically excludes the company from Shariah-compliant investment universes.</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Industry automatic ban due to ""Financial - Capital Markets"" classification</li>
  <li>Debt and cash investment ratios exceed permissible thresholds, with quality control issues affecting data integrity</li>
  <li>Non-Permissible Income ratio unavailable, preventing a granular purity assessment</li>
  <li>No purification or redemption process applicable</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>Portfolio managers should exercise caution and exclude The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. from Shariah-compliant portfolios, given the company’s automatic industry-based non-compliance classification. Attempts to address compliance through purification are not applicable based on current data and sector designation. Continuous monitoring for any change in business activities is recommended, but as of the current reporting period, inclusion is not permissible under Shariah investment guidelines.</p>",,,TRUE,FAIL,"Industry ""Financial - Capital Markets"" matches forbidden category (""financial - capital markets"") – automatically non Shariah compliant.","FAIL — Industry ""Financial - Capital Markets"" matches forbidden category (""financial - capital markets"") – automatically non Shariah compliant."

(PM)</h2>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Philip Morris International Inc. has been assessed and found <strong>Non-Compliant</strong> from a Shariah perspective. The company failed the Shariah screening primarily due to its engagement in the tobacco industry, which is categorically forbidden. No purification is applicable given the nature of the business. Additionally, multiple quality assurance issues were identified with key financial metrics, which further hinder a clear quantitative compliance analysis.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NYSE</p>
<p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Period:</strong> FY 2025</p>
<p><strong>Company Description:</strong> Philip Morris International Inc. is a leading international tobacco company focused on the manufacture and marketing of cigarettes and other tobacco products. It operates globally with a broad portfolio of well-known brands, aiming to transition its business toward smoke-free alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Business Segments Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Manufacture and sale of cigarettes</li>
  <li>Development and commercialization of smoke-free nicotine products</li>
  <li>Research and development in reduced-risk products</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quantitative Shariah Screening</h3>
<p>The company’s financial ratios could not be reliably assessed due to significant quality assurance issues. These included invalid or out-of-range figures for debt ratio, cash and investments ratio, and non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio. Consequently, no definitive NPIN percentage is provided, and purification ratios are marked at zero. The automatic screening failure is primarily linked to the sector classification rather than numerical financial thresholds.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>Philip Morris International operates in the tobacco industry, which is explicitly prohibited in Shariah compliance standards. The direct involvement in production and sale of tobacco products results in a 100% haram business classification by sector. No partial estimation or lower haram income percentage applies due to the direct nature of the forbidden activity. There are no identified dual-use considerations to mitigate the haram status.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Overall Verdict:</strong> NON-COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Screening Status:</strong> FAIL</p>
<p><strong>Purification Required:</strong> No</p>
<p>The company is automatically classified as non-compliant due to its industry association. This verdict is consistent with established Shariah frameworks that prohibit investment in tobacco-related activities.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The tobacco industry's categorization as haram leads to automatic exclusion under Shariah investment principles.</li>
  <li>Financial data quality issues complicate further quantitative analysis but do not override the clear sector-based prohibition.</li>
  <li>No purification process is feasible because the primary business is entirely non-permissible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Philip Morris International should be excluded from Shariah-compliant investment portfolios due to its absolute involvement in the tobacco industry. Portfolio managers should avoid allocating capital to this company regardless of any financial ratios or purification considerations. Continuous monitoring of similar sectoral risks and quality assurance in financial data is recommended for maintaining portfolio Shariah compliance.</p>",,,TRUE,FAIL,"Industry ""Tobacco"" matches forbidden category (""tobacco"") – automatically non Shariah compliant.","FAIL — Industry ""Tobacco"" matches forbidden category (""tobacco"") – automatically non Shariah compliant."

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Blackstone Inc. has been evaluated for Shariah compliance as of the reporting date October 23, 2025. The company’s screening status is <strong>FAIL</strong> due primarily to its core industry classification in asset management, which is considered a non-permissible sector under our Shariah screening criteria. No reliable quantitative data on non-permissible income (NPIN) was available to support a purification calculation. Consequently, the company is categorized as <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong> with no purification required or recommended.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p>Blackstone Inc. is a leading global asset management firm headquartered in the United States, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker ""BX"". The company specializes in alternative asset management with a diversified range of investment strategies and asset classes. Blackstone’s operations include private equity, real estate, credit, and hedge fund solutions, serving institutional investors worldwide.</p>

  <li>Private equity investments</li>
  <li>Real estate fund management</li>
  <li>Credit and insurance solutions</li>
  <li>Hedge fund advisory</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quantitative Shariah Screening</h3>
<p>The quantitative analysis for Blackstone Inc. has encountered several quality assurance (QA) issues affecting key financial ratios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Debt Ratio not in valid range [0,100]</li>
  <li>Cash and Investment Ratio not in valid range [0,100]</li>
  <li>NPIN Ratio not in valid range [0,100]</li>
  <li>Debt Ratio exceeds the 33% threshold</li>
  <li>Cash and Investment Ratio exceeds the 33% threshold</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to data inconsistencies, specific numerical values could not be reliably determined, and no precise non-permissible income figures were reported.</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>Blackstone Inc. operates in the “Asset Management” industry, which is classified as a forbidden category for Shariah compliance purposes by our screening rules. This automatic disqualification supersedes any partial assessments of revenue sustainability or purification potential.</p>
<p>The estimated percentage of revenue derived from non-permissible activities is effectively zero, but this metric is not applicable in this case due to the automatic ban based on industry classification.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> Blackstone Inc. is deemed non-compliant with Shariah investment principles because the asset management sector falls under industries prohibited outright according to our Shariah standards. No purification process is applicable or recommended, and the company fails all key screening checks.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Asset management business activities are considered non-permissible within the Islamic investment framework.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash/investment ratios show irregularities and exceed acceptable thresholds, indicating potential governance or data quality issues.</li>
  <li>Absence of a reliable non-permissible income ratio limits scope for purification or remediation.</li>
  <li>Automatic industry-level ban cannot be overridden by quantitative cleanses.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Based on the comprehensive Shariah screening, Blackstone Inc. should be excluded from Shariah-compliant investment portfolios. Portfolio managers are advised to avoid investment exposure in this stock due to its fundamental non-compliance stemming from forbidden industry classification. Continuous monitoring is recommended to detect any change in business focus or sector classification that might warrant reassessment in the future.</p>",,,TRUE,FAIL,"Industry ""Asset Management"" matches forbidden category (""asset management"") – automatically non Shariah compliant.","FAIL — Industry ""Asset Management"" matches forbidden category (""asset management"") – automatically non Shariah compliant."
