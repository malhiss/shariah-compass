Screening status: PASS. Reported NPIN ratio: 0.00% of revenue. Purification ratio: 0% (no additional purification currently applied). Estimated haram-sector share of revenue: ≈ 0.0% (range 0.0%–1.0%). Main haram-related drivers: Interest-based income or lending (none at Mastercard) (~0.0% of revenue). Board-facing non-compliant revenue estimate: point ≈ 0.00%, lower 0.00%, upper 1.00% of total revenue. Key qualitative flags: NO_ISSUE, CLIENTS_HARAM_SECTOR, NON_PERMISSIBLE_SECTOR, CLIENTS_HARAM_SECTOR, CLIENTS_HARAM_SECTOR, CLIENTS_HARAM_SECTOR. LLM severity profile: max severity 4, avg severity 0.63. LLM rationale: LLM detected FAIL in 1 chunk(s). Key issues: Chunk 6: The chunk describes Mastercard’s core activities around conventional payments and financial services, including supporting issuers and acquirers, optimizing payment authorizations, and aiding lending practices (e.g., Equifax in Australia using open finance to inform lending). It also references merchant acceptance, gateway tokenization, and fraud/authorization tools for issuers, all integral to conventional card and lending ecosystems. While the text does not state interest income explicitly, the business model presented is squarely within conventional finance.. LLM detected CAUTION in 7 chunk(s). Key themes: Chunk 1: The disclosure centers on partnerships and portfolio wins with conventional banks (e.g., Nordea, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Saudi Awwal Bank, Saudi National Bank, Doha Bank, Itau, Banco do Brasil) and on credit card programs for affluent segments. This indicates the company’s clients operate in a non-permissible sector, but the text does not show Mastercard itself earning interest income or conducting lending. Hence, caution is warranted based on client sector exposure, not a fail. | Chunk 2: This chunk indicates the company’s core business is conventional payments processing (e.g., Mastercard network, card acceptance, open/closed-loop transit payments, and digital wallet enablement). Conventional financial services are a Shariah red flag at the sector level. The text does not explicitly mention interest income or lending here, so it warrants caution rather than a definitive fail. | Chunk 3: The chunk describes Mastercard enabling payments on its network and explicitly partnering with conventional banks (U.S. Bank and Citibank) whose core businesses are interest-based. It also mentions crypto/stablecoin co-brand card programs but does not state that Mastercard itself earns interest income or engages in prohibited sectors.

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>Total Estimated Haram Revenue:</strong> ≈ 0.0% (Range: 0.0%–1.0%)</p>
<p><strong>Key Haram Segment:</strong> Interest-based income or lending (none at Mastercard) (~0.0% of revenue)</p>
<p>Mastercard operates as a four-party payments network and does not engage in card issuance, credit extension, or earning interest income from cardholders. All revenues are derived from network and service fees, which are deemed permissible under Shariah principles.</p>

<h4>Haram Revenue Composition</h4>
<p>Composition detail: N/A (not provided).</p>

<h4>Haram Sector Segment-Level Reasoning</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interest-based income or lending (none at Mastercard):</strong> Mastercard explicitly states it does not act as a financial institution nor generate revenue from interest or lending activities. Its earnings come strictly from network access fees and value-added services. This segment is estimated to contribute 0% haram revenue with high confidence (0.85). This aligns with the dual-use logic where infrastructure fees for payment networks are permissible even if they serve conventional banks that operate with interest. Limitations include the revenue-only scope, excluding non-operating interest or investment income below the revenue line.</li>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>The security passes all primary Shariah compliance screens with a final ruling of <strong>COMPLIANT</strong>. The screening status is <em>PASS</em>. The company’s non-permissible income is effectively zero and well below the 5% NPIN threshold. There is no purification required at this time.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mastercard is not a lender nor does it earn interest income; all revenues arise from permissible payments network fees and services.</li>
  <li>The company’s clients include conventional banks which operate in non-permissible sectors, but Mastercard’s own revenue streams remain pure based on its business model.</li>
  <li>Dual-use nature of Mastercard’s services—providing neutral infrastructure to various financial entities—does not render its income haram.</li>
  <li>Debt and liquidity ratios are well within Shariah-compliant limits.</li>
  <li>No purification is recommended given the zero NPIN and haram income estimates.</li>
  <li>Some residual caution due to exposure to clients in interest-based conventional banking sector, but this does not impact Mastercard’s own compliance.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Mastercard Incorporated is permissible for investment within a Shariah-compliant portfolio. No purification of dividends or gains is necessary based on current financial data and screening results.</p>
<p>Portfolio managers should note the company’s role as a payments infrastructure provider and monitor ongoing disclosures to ensure there are no structural changes involving interest-bearing income.</p>
<p>Although the company’s clients operate in conventional banking, Mastercard’s fee-based revenue model keeps it within acceptable Shariah guidelines. Continued due diligence on exposure to haram sectors through partnership developments is recommended.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,COMPLIANT,"Mastercard is Shariah-compliant with 0% non-permissible income.

Screening status: FAIL. Reported NPIN ratio: 6.87% of revenue. Purification ratio: 0% (no additional purification currently applied). Estimated haram-sector share of revenue: ≈ 41.9% (range 31.3%–52.5%). Main haram-related drivers: Defense and military AI/targeting and battle‑management software (Government segment – defense subset) (~35.0% of revenue), Interest income (riba) from cash, cash equivalents, and short‑term U.S. Treasury securities (~6.9% of revenue).

It also emphasizes strong U.S. government revenue growth and mission-critical support, reinforcing defense as a core business line. Additionally, it references work with a leading insurance company, which is a client in a non-permissible sector, though that pertains to the client rather than the company’s own sector. | Chunk 3: The chunk shows the company is directly building and deploying defense-specific solutions: it powers the U.S. Army’s Vantage data platform “built on foundry and AIP,” and AI Hivemind generates “intricate mission plans” for government use in Gaia and Maverick. It emphasizes enhancing Army lethality and mentions classified-space origins and edge uses for drones and robots. This indicates core revenue and product orientation toward military/defense programs. | Chunk 4: The chunk describes products and programs explicitly serving the U.S. Army and the defense industrial base, aiming to make the army “the most lethal in the world.” It references enabling Army Future Force systems and adoption “across the traditional defense industrial base and the maritime industrial base.” This indicates core revenue and operations tied directly to defense/military programs.. LLM detected CAUTION in 4 chunk(s). Key themes: Chunk 6: The chunk emphasizes significant revenue from the U.S. government and government segment growth but does not explicitly describe defense-specific or weapons-focused activities. It frames offerings around commercial AI use cases (AIP) and general government programs. Given government clientele without clear defense-only positioning, this indicates dual-use/government exposure rather than core defense. No interest income or other haram sectors are mentioned. | Chunk 7: The chunk emphasizes growth in ""government software offerings"" and increased ""international government revenue,"" including continued work in the U.K. It does not indicate the software is designed specifically for military or weapons programs. Therefore, this suggests general-purpose technology sold to government clients (dual-use) rather than core defense/weapons activity. No interest income or other clearly haram revenue is mentioned in this excerpt. | Chunk 8: The chunk states the company ended the quarter with $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury securities.

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Overall Verdict:</strong> NON-COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Screening Result:</strong> FAIL</p>
<p>The company's core involvement in defense and military software solutions combined with significant interest income renders it non-compliant with Shariah principles under common screening methodologies. The NPIN exceeds the 5% threshold, and the haram revenue share is substantial at nearly 42%.</p>

  <li>Revenues derived directly from software programs explicitly enabling military targeting, lethality, and battle management violate Shariah imperatives against involvement in warfare activities causing harm.</li>
  <li>Interest income from cash holdings and short-term treasury securities is considered riba and non-permissible under AAOIFI and common Shariah standards.</li>
  <li>Despite low debt levels and non-high cash ratios, the NPIN level surpasses the acceptable maximum of 5%, impacting overall compliance.</li>
  <li>Dual-use government revenue is not deemed neutral as the company's government contracts are predominantly defense-oriented and directly linked to military operations.</li>
  <li>Current practice shows no purification applied; however, due to high haram exposure, purification may be insufficient to restore compliance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Given Palantir Technologies Inc.'s non-compliance status and the significant involvement in non-permissible defense activities and interest-bearing income, it is recommended to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Avoid new investments</strong> in PLTR as it currently does not meet Shariah compliance standards.</li>
  <li>Consider divestment or exclusion from Shariah-compliant portfolios unless circumstances change materially.</li>
  <li>Monitor any potential purification approaches, although given the high haram revenue proportion, these may not be practical or sufficient.</li>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Costco Wholesale Corporation (""Costco"") has undergone a comprehensive Shariah compliance screening for the reporting period ending December 11, 2025. The company successfully passed all quantitative and qualitative Shariah screening criteria, achieving an overall Shariah verdict of <strong>COMPLIANT</strong>. Key financial ratios such as debt, cash and investments, and non-permissible income ratios fall well within acceptable thresholds. No purification is required as the non-permissible income remains negligible.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NASDAQ<br>
<strong>Country:</strong> United States<br>
<strong>Reporting Period:</strong> FY 2025<br>
</p>
<p>Costco Wholesale Corporation is a leading global warehouse-club retailer renowned for offering a wide assortment of merchandise including groceries, appliances, electronics, and household goods at competitive prices primarily to its membership base. The company operates large-scale membership-only warehouse stores targeting value-conscious consumers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Membership warehouse clubs</li>
  <li>Retail sales of groceries including beverages and food products</li>
  <li>General merchandise and ancillary services</li>
  <li>Co-branded credit card services (issued by banks, not core business)</li>
</ul>

  <tr><td>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) Ratio</td><td>0.21%</td><td>≤5%</td><td>Pass</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The company's primary business model as a warehouse-club retailer inherently involves minimal engagement with interest-based or non-compliant financial activities. Costco does not earn interest income as a core business, and co-branded credit cards are issued by third-party banks.</p>
<p>Potential non-permissible revenue sources include retail sales of alcohol and pork products. Based on estimation and category benchmarks, the combined haram revenue share is approximately 3.6% of total revenue, staying below the 5% Shariah threshold for compliance with purification. Although the upper bound estimate approximates the 5% limit (~5.0%), the current assessment deems the company compliant without the need for purification.</p>
<p>No other haram or dual-use sector involvement was identified. The non-permissible income ratio reported stands at 0.21%, consistent with internal assessments. Current screening indicates no material qualitative or quantitative red flags.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Shariah Compliance Status:</strong> PASS<br>
<strong>Final Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT<br>
<strong>Purification Required:</strong> No (0.21% purification ratio currently applied)<br>
</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The company's debt and liquidity ratios are conservative and well within Shariah-compliant limits.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income arises mainly from retail sales of alcohol and pork products, which are intrinsic to the retail sector context but remain below the 5% threshold.</li>
  <li>Purification is not currently recommended given the low NPIN ratio.</li>
  <li>No evidence of involvement in haram financial instruments, interest-based income, or impermissible business activities.</li>
  <li>Internal QA review indicates compliance with no significant issues beyond a minor data validation note unrelated to Shariah compliance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Given Costco Wholesale Corporation’s current Shariah-compliant status, it remains suitable for inclusion in Shariah-compliant investment portfolios. Portfolio managers should continue monitoring the company’s non-permissible revenue streams, particularly the proportion derived from alcohol and pork sales, as fluctuations could impact the compliance status over time.</p>
<p>No purification action is necessary at this time, but regular review of updated financial information and revenue breakdowns is recommended. The company's low leverage and conservative cash management further support its suitability from a Shariah screening perspective.</p>
<p>Should any significant changes in business model or revenue mix occur, a re-assessment would be warranted to ensure ongoing compliance.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,,,,,,,

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>AbbVie Inc. has been evaluated for Shariah compliance as of October 31, 2025. The company’s overall screening resulted in a <strong>FAIL</strong> status, with a final Shariah classification of <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong>. The non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio stands at 3.47% of revenue, supported by a point estimate of non-compliant revenue at approximately 2.5%, within a range of 2.1% to 2.9%. The primary drivers of non-permissible income are non-operating interest income (riba) and activities linked to alcoholic ready-to-drink (RTD) brand licensing and beverage bases. Despite the NPIN ratio being below the 5% threshold, the combined assessment leads to a non-compliant verdict. Purification of dividend or distributable income, if held, is estimated at 3.47%.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The company’s screening status is FAIL due to the combined non-permissible income estimate of approximately 2.5% (range 2.1%–2.9%), largely driven by non-operating interest income and alcohol-related licensing activities. Despite the NPIN ratio being under the 5% threshold—commonly accepted for permissibility—the nature of haram income and the presence of alcohol-linked revenues lead to a non-compliant classification. Purification of dividends or earnings, if invested in, is recommended at approximately 3.47%. The final verdict should guide exclusion or purification decisions in Shariah-compliant portfolios.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Interest income (riba) generated on cash equivalents and investments is fully non-permissible and comprises the largest portion (~2.1%) of haram income.</li>
  <li>Revenue from authorization and licensing of trademarks for alcoholic RTD products and sale of beverage bases (~0.4%) are impermissible under Shariah.</li>
  <li>The company operates primarily in healthcare and pharmaceutical manufacturing, which is permissible and not considered dual-use.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash+investment ratios are within acceptable Shariah thresholds.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income is below 5%, but the presence of alcohol-related revenue triggers a fail status.</li>
  <li>Purification of dividends/earnings at ~3.47% is recommended if held in portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>AbbVie Inc. is currently classified as <em>non-compliant</em> due to non-permissible income sources, particularly riba and alcohol licensing.</li>
  <li>Holding the stock is allowed only if purification of dividends/earnings is conducted at approximately 3.47%.</li>
  <li>Careful monitoring of changes in revenue composition, especially in non-permissible segments, is advised for future reassessments.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash ratios are compliant; however, the alcohol-related revenues constitute a significant concern.</li>
  <li>No immediate board-level review is required, but routine compliance checks should continue based on financial disclosures.</li>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>
This Shariah screening report assesses The Coca-Cola Company as of October 21, 2025. Despite the company being primarily categorized within the non-alcoholic beverages sector, the screening has identified significant non-compliant activities linked to core defense businesses, attributed to the Raytheon Technologies (RTX) defense segments. The screening status is a firm FAIL, yielding a final Shariah classification of NON_COMPLIANT.
</p>
<p>
Key financial ratios meet Shariah thresholds for debt and liquid assets, with debt at 15.38% and cash plus investments at 11.38%, both within acceptable limits. Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) stands at 2.10%, below the 5% threshold requiring purification. However, the estimated proportion of haram-sector revenue is substantially above the acceptable limit at approximately 53.1% (range 47.1% to 57.2%), driven predominantly by defense and military-related activities.
</p>
<p>
Additional flags include involvement in alcohol-related products (notably Bacardí collaborations with Coca-Cola), contributing to the overall non-compliance. Given these factors, investors are advised to avoid new investments in this company.

<h2>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h2>
<p>The company's estimated haram revenue is approximately 53.1% of total revenue, with a range between 47.1% and 57.2%, well above the acceptable limits. This substantial haram exposure primarily originates from defense-related activities linked to the Raytheon Technologies division.</p>

<h3>Haram Revenue Composition</h3>
<p>Composition detail: N/A (not provided).</p>

<h3>Key Haram Segments Description</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Raytheon (RTX business):</strong> Core weapons and integrated air & missile defense (~31.5% of revenue), including design and production of missiles, interceptors, radars, and integrated defense systems serving U.S. and allied militaries. This segment is fully classified as haram.</li>
  <li><strong>Pratt & Whitney:</strong> Military Engines production and sustainment (~11.2% of revenue) for fighter and transport aircraft; only military-related engine sales are counted as haram.</li>
  <li><strong>Collins Aerospace:</strong> Military avionics, mission systems, actuation, and power/thermal management for defense platforms (~10.3% of revenue), focusing exclusively on military-specific products.</li>
  <li><strong>Riba (Interest Income):</strong> Non-operating interest and similar finance income constitute approximately 0.13% of total revenue and are also considered non-permissible income.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Red Flag Industries Noted</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Defense and military core industries</li>
  <li>Alcohol (notably Bacardí collaborations with Coca-Cola in some regions)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dual-Use Assessment</h3>
<p>The haram segments represent core defense and weapons activities rather than neutral or dual-use infrastructure. The presence of alcohol-related flags corroborates the classification as non-dual-use and non-permissible.</p>

<hr>
<h3>References</h3>
<p>Note: No direct haram composition items or references were provided in the data for this company application.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Shariah Screening Status:</strong> FAIL</p>
<p><strong>Final Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Despite financial ratios compliant with Shariah thresholds, the company demonstrates a significant haram revenue exposure (~53.1%) mainly due to substantial business in prohibited defense/military sectors and involvement in alcohol-related products. This leads to a non-compliant Shariah status.</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Estimated haram revenue well above the 5% tolerance, primarily from core arms and defense manufacturing.</li>
  <li>Presence of non-permissible income from riba-based interest.</li>
  <li>Alcohol involvement evidenced through product collaborations — a definite non-permissible activity.</li>
  <li>Purification of distributable income is recommended but insufficient to mitigate fundamental haram exposure.</li>
  <li>Ambiguity in company identity and revenue allocations necessitates careful board scrutiny.</li>
  <li>Avoidance of assisting in sin and taking part in doubtful matters underpin the negative screening.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>
Given the substantial haram revenue exceeding Shariah-compliant limits and the multiple red flags related to defense and alcohol sectors, it is advised to avoid initiating new investments in The Coca-Cola Company under its current assessment. Existing holdings should be reviewed, and consideration given to divestment depending on fiduciary and Shariah compliance policies.
</p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Shariah compliance screening for RTX Corporation (Ticker: RTX) as of the report date 2025-10-21 indicates a final classification of <strong>COMPLIANT</strong> with a passing screening status. Key financial ratio highlights include a debt ratio of 18.06%, cash and investments ratio of 3.29%, and a non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio of 0.13%, all well within acceptable Shariah thresholds. Although the company has a significant core defense and weapons business comprising an estimated ~60% of total revenue, which under standard non-permissible revenue considerations would indicate non-compliance, the overall classification accounts for sector-screening allowances and purification where required. No purification is recommended at this time.</p>

<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Ticker:</strong> RTX</p>
<p><strong>Company Name:</strong> RTX Corporation</p>
<p><strong>Exchange:</strong> NYSE</p>
<p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>RTX's business model is predominantly within aerospace and defense sectors, with core revenue drivers derived from military and weapons systems, including missiles, munitions, integrated air and missile defense, and military propulsion engines. The estimated exposure to non-permissible defense-related revenue is approximately 60% of total revenue based on typical segment mixes and industry knowledge.</p>
<p>Despite this significant estimated haram revenue from defense-related activities, the numeric NPIN figure reported is a minor 0.13%, primarily reflecting interest and other minor non-compliant income sources rather than core defense revenues. This divergence arises because standard NPIN metrics do not capture core weapons production under the automated screening logic.</p>
<p>Given the dual-use nature of some aerospace segments and the breakdown of military versus civil activities, the firm is treated with due consideration under Shariah guidance.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Screening Status:</strong> PASS</p>
<p><strong>Purification Required:</strong> No</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> While RTX Corporation’s core operations exhibit significant involvement in defense and military products—which are inherently non-permissible—its overall Shariah compliance assessment, considering the quantitative ratios and qualitative reviews, supports a compliant classification under Islamic finance standards. The NPIN ratio is significantly below threshold, and no purification is currently mandated. This reflects the specific sector screening approach applied.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Core defense and military segments contribute a major share of revenue, estimated ~60%, classified as non-permissible under Shariah.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income detected is low (0.13%) and relates mainly to minor income sources, not core defense revenue.</li>
  <li>Debt and liquidity ratios are within acceptable Shariah standards.</li>
  <li>Several qualitative flags indicating defense-related revenue concentration were noted; however, these are accounted for in the final classification.</li>
  <li>No purification is recommended currently, as NPIN is negligible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers should be aware that RTX Corporation’s primary business involves a large share of defense-related operations, traditionally considered non-permissible in Islamic finance due to their nature. However, under the applied sector screening framework and given the company's NPIN ratio well below limits, RTX is currently classified as Shariah compliant. Managers should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continuously monitor any changes in the company’s business mix, particularly shifts increasing non-permissible revenue beyond thresholds.</li>
  <li>Consider the impact of sector screening methodologies and remain alert to any regulatory guidance updates concerning defense sector investments.</li>
  <li>Review purification requirements if future NPIN ratios increase or additional interest-based income emerges.</li>
  <li>Report any material changes in business operations or financial ratios promptly to the Shariah compliance committee for reassessment.</li>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>McDonald’s Corporation’s Shariah compliance screening for the reporting period ending November 5, 2025, resulted in a <strong>NON-COMPLIANT</strong> classification. The company’s non-permissible income predominantly arises from interest-based income (riba) and finance income which accounts for approximately 3.9% of total revenue, exceeding the company’s reported nominal NPIN ratio of 0.4%. Despite passing the 5% NPIN rule with a point estimate below this threshold, the overall screening status fails due to the conservative estimate of haram revenue between 3.5% and 4.2%. McDonald’s core restaurant and franchise operations are considered neutral from a Shariah perspective and do not contribute to non-compliance.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p>McDonald’s Corporation is classified as <strong>NON-COMPLIANT</strong> based on the overall screening which accounts for the material presence of conventional interest income (riba) in its financial profile. The estimated haram-sector share of revenue is approximately 3.9% (ranging from 3.5% to 4.2%). Although the company passes the NPIN quantitative threshold of 5%, conservative Shariah prudence and the nature of income sources lead to a failed comprehensive screening status.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON-COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Screening Status:</strong> FAIL</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>

  <li>Avoid new investments or increases in holdings if adhering strictly to Shariah compliance mandates.</li>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p>The overall Shariah classification for Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is <strong>COMPLIANT WITH PURIFICATION</strong>. The company’s financial ratios comply with thresholds set for debt and non-permissible income, with a purification obligation of approximately 0.78% of distributable income due to incidental interest income and minor alcohol licensing revenue. The company may be held in Shariah-compliant portfolios subject to purification.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Non-permissible income is primarily derived from conventional interest on cash and finance income, constituting riba.</li>
  <li>Minor non-permissible revenue is also attributed to alcohol-related brand licensing activities which are incidental and marginal.</li>
  <li>The company’s core business operations in medical instruments and supplies are permissible.</li>
  <li>Debt and other financial ratios remain well below Shariah screening thresholds, indicating sound compliance.</li>
  <li>Purification is mandatory to cleanse dividend income related to the identified non-permissible revenue.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is an allowed holding for Shariah-compliant portfolios with a recommended purification of approximately 0.78% of dividends and earnings to account for non-permissible income. The company’s incidental exposure to conventional interest income and minimal alcohol-related licensing revenue requires regular monitoring to ensure continued adherence to Shariah compliance guidelines. Portfolio managers should maintain this purification practice in dividend distributions and remain vigilant to changes in the company’s financial profile or business activities. No board review is required at this time, and current QA issues relate solely to interest income exceeding the warning threshold but remain within permissible limits.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,Compliant with Purification,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is Shariah compliant with a small portion of income from interest and minimal alcohol-related licensing.

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>PepsiCo, Inc. fails the Shariah compliance screening mainly due to the inclusion of riba-based income derived from its interest holdings. The company's Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio stands at 0.78% of revenue, with an estimated haram-sector share of total revenue approximately 1.4% (within a range of 1.2% to 1.6%). Despite this, the company's debt ratio is 22.17%, well within the acceptable threshold, and its cash and investment levels remain moderate at 6.21%. Current purification efforts are aligned with NPIN values, suggesting a purification ratio of 0.78% applied to distributable income.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of its haram income—primarily interest income from cash equivalents and marketable securities—the company is categorized as non-compliant but allowed holding with purification advised.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <em>NON_COMPLIANT</em></p>
<p>Despite passing key quantitative metrics such as debt and NPIN thresholds, the presence of riba-based interest income at an estimated ~1.37% of revenue leads to a final Shariah non-compliant classification. However, purification of dividends/earnings at approximately 1.37% is recommended to mitigate impermissible income exposure.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Non-permissible income primarily originates from riba (interest) on financial assets rather than core business activities.</li>
  <li>Debt level and cash investments remain within Shariah-approved limits.</li>
  <li>Purification is advised to address the riba-based income detected.</li>
  <li>No issues identified related to inherently haram products or services from PepsiCo.</li>
  <li>Reports rely on fiscal year 2025 financials with interest calculations based on disclosed income and industry knowledge.</li>
  <li>Company is not classified as dual-use; the haram income arises solely from financial activities, not operational products.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>The holding in PepsiCo, Inc. is allowed with an advised purification of approximately 1.37% of dividends or earnings to cleanse the riba-based income portion. Continuous monitoring of interest income fluctuations is recommended in subsequent reporting periods. As the company does not engage in intrinsically haram business activities and debt levels are controlled, risk from Shariah non-compliance is considered manageable with purification.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,NON_COMPLIANT,"PepsiCo fails Shariah screening due to riba-based income of about 1.4% of revenue.

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>NVIDIA Corporation has been assessed for Shariah compliance as at 2025-11-19. The company fails Shariah screening primarily due to its non-permissible income (NPIN) profile exceeding acceptable thresholds. The reported NPIN ratio stands at 1.37% of total revenue, dominated by interest and dividend income (riba), gambling-related commissions via App Store third-party applications, and advertising revenue linked to gambling activities. Despite these non-compliances, the NPIN remains below the 5% Purification threshold, leading to no purification requirement. However, the overall classification for NVIDIA is <em>Non-Compliant</em>. Portfolio managers are advised that the company is an allowed holding with approximately 1.3% purification of dividends/earnings recommended.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Screening Status:</strong> FAIL</p>
<p><strong>Final Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Non-Permissible Income Estimate:</strong> Approximately 1.3% of total revenue (range 0.79% to 1.81%).</p>
<p><strong>Purification Recommendation:</strong> Not required under current screening rules (NPIN below 5%).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Exposure to <em>riba</em> through interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible earnings from facilitation and commission on gambling and simulated gambling apps in Apple's App Store.</li>
  <li>Advertising revenue from gambling-related advertisers, both real-money and simulated gambling.</li>
  <li>Dual-use technology caution: NVIDIA’s AI and semiconductor products are general-purpose but sold to sovereign/government customers, necessitating caution though not constituting a core Shariah fail.</li>
  <li>NPIN levels below 5% threshold limit purification requirements but still result in non-compliance on screening.</li>
  <li>Consistent with Shariah principles to avoid assisting sin and transgression (ta’awun ‘ala al-ithm) and doubtful matters due to limited disclosure.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>NVIDIA Corporation is currently a non-compliant holding under Shariah screening due to its exposure to <em>riba</em> and indirect involvement with gambling-related activities via App Store commissions and advertising. The company’s NPIN is approximately 1.3%, which is below the 5% purification threshold; hence, no purification is strictly required. However, purification of dividends or distributable income by the stated NPIN percentage (~1.37%) is recommended as prudent compliance practice.</p>
<p>Portfolio managers should be aware of the dual-use rating caution due to sales of general-purpose AI hardware to government customers but note that this is not deemed a core breach. Holding NVIDIA must be monitored periodically for any change in risk exposures. Engagement with the company or close monitoring of reporting disclosures on financial income and segment activities is advisable.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,Non-Compliant,"NVIDIA is non-compliant due to ~1.3% non-permissible income mainly from interest and gambling-related commissions.

<h3>5. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>Apple Inc. is classified as <strong>COMPLIANT WITH PURIFICATION</strong>. The company's business activities are predominantly permissible with incidental non-permissible income related primarily to treasury interest income and limited advertising revenue from non-permissible sectors such as alcohol and gambling. The total haram revenue is estimated at approximately 1.5%, which is below the 5% threshold. Purification of dividends and earnings at the recommended rate of approximately 1.5% is required.</p>

<h3>6. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Interest-based income arises from conventional fixed-income securities and banking deposits held in treasury portfolios, constituting the dominant haram exposure.</li>
  <li>Advertising revenue includes a small portion related to non-permissible sectors, primarily controlled and restricted through platform policies.</li>
  <li>The company’s primary business is neutral/dual-use consumer technology and services; thus, non-permissible exposures are incidental.</li>
  <li>Debt and liquidity levels are well within Shariah-compliant limits, supporting financial soundness.</li>
  <li>The company does not hold preferred or trust shares that would affect compliance status.</li>
  <li>Screening incorporates a cautious approach due to indirect exposures via clients in conventional finance and estimated interest income.</li>
  <li>Purification is mandatory given the presence of non-permissible income, with a clear method recommended for dividend purifications.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Apple Inc. is an approved holding for Islamic portfolios under the current screening results. Managers should apply the recommended purification of approximately 1.5% on dividends and earnings before distribution to investors. The company’s exposure to non-permissible income is low and stable, reflecting no immediate red flags for Shariah compliance. Continuing monitoring is advised with attention to potential changes in interest income and advertising policy enforcement related to non-permissible sectors.</p>
<p>Portfolio managers should note the <em>PASS WITH PURIFICATION</em> status and ensure shareholders understand the need for purification. No board review is required at present. The company’s activities remain substantially Shariah-compliant, with incidental non-compliant revenues appropriately managed.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,COMPLIANT WITH PURIFICATION,Apple Inc. is Shariah compliant with a small non-permissible income portion (~1.5%) mainly from interest and restricted advertising income.

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>The company is classified as <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong> under Shariah screening despite its NPIN being below the 5% threshold. The non-compliance arises primarily from riba-based income through interest and dividends, and to a minor extent from advertising revenues associated with prohibited categories such as gambling and adult content. Purification of distributable income at 1.28% is recommended. Debt and cash & investment ratios are within acceptable Shariah limits.</p>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The NPIN ratio (1.28%) is below the 5% maximum threshold but above the stricter internal threshold applied, leading to non-compliance status.</li>
  <li>Interest and dividends income is treated conservatively as fully non-permissible due to aggregation and lack of detailed portfolio split.</li>
  <li>Advertisement revenue generated from prohibited categories (gambling, adult content) is minimal but factored into the NPIN calculation.</li>
  <li>Company operations include dual-use technologies providing neutral infrastructure; exposure arises mainly from treasury and minor advertising segments.</li>
  <li>Purification of dividend and earnings distribution is necessary to cleanse impermissible income portions.</li>
  <li>Debt level (0.68%) and cash/investments ratio (3.54%) comply with Shariah standards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Alphabet Inc. is an allowed holding with a recommendation for purification of approximately 1.28% of dividends or distributable earnings attributable to non-permissible income sources. Portfolio managers should monitor the company’s treasury income mix and advertising policies continuously, especially given the small but present exposure to prohibited categories in advertising. Maintaining scrutiny on updated financial disclosures is advisable to ensure ongoing compliance and proper calculation of purification. The current non-compliant revenue share is relatively low and supports continued investment with appropriate purification mechanisms in place.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,Non-Compliant,"Alphabet Inc. is non-compliant due to ~1.0% revenue from non-permissible sources, mainly interest/dividends and minor advertising in prohibited categories.

<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3>
<p>
Microsoft Corporation has been rated as <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong> in this Shariah compliance screening for the period ending 2025-10-29. The company’s Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) stands at 1.39% of total revenue, triggering a fail in screening despite the overall low level of haram sector revenue estimated at approximately 0.4% (range from 0.2% to 0.6%). 
</p>
<p>
The primary sources of non-permissible income relate to retail sales of alcoholic beverages (~0.3%) and pork products (~0.1%) through owned grocery operations. Additionally, Microsoft has generated interest income from its financial activities, which also contributes to the NPIN. The debt and cash ratios remain well within acceptable limits. Purification of dividends at 1.39% is recommended where applicable.

<h4>Haram Segments Detail</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Alcoholic Beverages Retail Sales:</strong> Involves revenue from beer, wine, and spirits sales predominantly through Whole Foods Market physical stores and Amazon Fresh/Prime Now grocery delivery in jurisdictions allowing spirits sales. Estimated to represent ~0.3% of total revenue. The company excludes any dual-use infrastructure revenues related to AWS or logistics.</li>
  <li><strong>Pork Products Retail Sales:</strong> Revenue from fresh and processed pork products offered across Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh grocery channels, estimated at ~0.08% of total revenue.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These haram-related retail activities are a small fraction of total company revenue and are clearly segregated from its core software and infrastructure business, which is dual-use and permissible.</p>

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>
<strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT<br>
Microsoft Corporation has failed the Shariah compliance screening on account of non-permissible income from minor alcohol and pork retail sales as well as interest income from financial activities.<br>
The non-permissible income ratio stands at 1.39%, with haram sector revenue estimated at approximately 0.38% of total revenue. The company’s core business remains Shariah compliant and is considered dual-use infrastructure software.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Purification is recommended on dividends and earnings equivalent to the NPIN ratio (1.39%).</li>
  <li>Alcoholic beverage sales occur via owned grocery retail operations, representing ~0.3% of revenue. This is clearly non-permissible due to the khamr (wine/beer/spirits) content.</li>
  <li>Pork product retail sales contribute roughly 0.1% of revenue and are non-permissible.</li>
  <li>Interest income is present due to financial income, requiring purification though it is non-core to the main operating business.</li>
  <li>Core software and infrastructure operations are permissible and dual-use; haram activities are segregated to grocery retail categories.</li>
  <li>The company’s debt and cash levels are low and within acceptable Shariah limits.</li>
  <li>Risk flags include the presence of clients in the conventional banking sector and minor interest income exposure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>
Microsoft Corporation is an <em>allowed holding</em> with some caution due to its minor NPIN and haram sector exposures. Purification at approximately 0.38% (reflecting the point estimate of haram revenue) or 1.39% (NPIN ratio) is advised on dividends and earnings distributed.<br>
Portfolio managers should monitor the evolving composition of retail food revenue, especially in alcohol and pork, as well as interest income disclosures. Continued exclusion of dual-use infrastructure revenues from haram calculations is important.<br>
Due to the small scale of non-permissible activities and overall Shariah compliance of core operations, the company remains investable within Shariah-constrained portfolios subject to purification.<br>
No board review is required at this time.

Total revenue for the same nine-month period was $141,073m. Treating only interest income as non-permissible yields ~$1,498m / $141,073m ≈ 1.06% of total revenue.

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) was evaluated for its Shariah compliance status as of its 2025 reporting period. The company currently reports a non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio of 0.73%, which is below the 5% threshold. However, detailed segment analysis estimates approximately 1.1% of total revenue arises from haram sources, specifically non-operating interest and investment income (riba). Although this is a relatively low percentage, it exceeds certain Shariah screening criteria, resulting in a <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong> final verdict and an overall fail on the screening status.</p>
<p>There are no concerns relating to debt and cash investment ratios, both comfortably within acceptable limits. Dual-use cautions arise from Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure being sold to government and commercial sectors, but these do not constitute core military or defense revenue and are noted as cautions rather than disqualifiers.</p>
<p>No purification is deemed required for investors, given the NPIN ratio, inferring a manageable level of impermissible income in the company's earnings distribution.</p>

<h2>Company Overview</h2>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> While Amazon’s debt and NPIN ratios fall within acceptable bounds, the total share of haram revenue exceeds internal conservative screening thresholds, driven by interest income from non-operating financial assets. Additionally, dual-use caution is noted owing to AWS services sold to government customers, posing potential risk areas.</p>
<p>Investors should consider this non-compliance when making portfolio decisions, though no purification is required due to NPIN being below the 5% cutoff.</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Primary source of impermissible income is riba-based interest from cash equivalents and debt securities.</li>
  <li>Debt ratio and cash+investment holdings remain low and well within acceptable thresholds.</li>
  <li>Dual-use caution flagged for cloud infrastructure offerings that serve both commercial and government sectors, including possible defense-related uses, but do not directly generate haram revenue.</li>
  <li>No direct involvement in sectors explicitly forbidden in Shariah.</li>
  <li>The company does not require purification via dividend cleansing given the NPIN ratio below 5%.</li>
  <li>Regulatory filings and detailed financial disclosures form the basis of screening and estimate calculations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>Amazon.com, Inc. is classified as a <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong> holding due primarily to its minor but measurable income from non-operating interest sources. Given its NPIN ratio of 0.73%, below the 5% threshold, the company remains a potential holding with recommended purification of approximately 1.1% against dividends or distributable income to cleanse impermissible earnings.</p>
<p>This holding should be monitored for any shifts in financial composition, especially changes in interest income or further regulatory updates. Portfolio managers should note the dual-use nature of AWS services and apply appropriate caution but not treat this as a disqualifier, as these are general-purpose infrastructure products.</p>
<p>Overall, Amazon can be maintained in portfolios with the appropriate purification process applied and ongoing Shariah supervision to address any material changes to its financial profile.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,NON_COMPLIANT,"Amazon has minor impermissible income (~1.1% from interest), exceeding some screening limits.

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>The company is deemed <strong>Compliant with Purification</strong>. The NPIN ratio (1.53%) is safely under the 5% Shariah threshold, requiring purification of approximately 1.53% on distributable income to cleanse earnings linked to non-permissible insurance activities. No issues of assisting in sin or doubtful matters were detected that would otherwise affect the verdict.</p>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The primary non-permissible income driver is conventional vehicle insurance revenue embedded within Tesla Insurance operations, which entails gharar (uncertainty) and riba (interest) elements, rendering it haram.</li>
  <li>Meta’s core platform, advertising, and AI-related businesses are fully permissible and comprise the vast majority of revenue.</li>
  <li>The small haram segment (~1%) falls well below the 5% NPIN limit, enabling portfolio inclusion after purification.</li>
  <li>Purification through proportional dividend cleansing at 1.53% is recommended to meet Shariah compliance requirements.</li>
  <li>There is no indication of involvement in other major haram sectors such as conventional banking or alcohol.</li>
  <li>Minor QA concerns on data inputs do not impact the overall screening outcome.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>This company is an <strong>allowed holding</strong> from a Shariah perspective, conditional upon purification at approximately 1% of dividends or distributable earnings linked to the small haram insurance segment. Portfolio managers should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply purification deductions to dividends and earnings distributions to cleanse income derived from conventional vehicle insurance activities.</li>
  <li>Monitor upcoming financial disclosures for any material changes in the share or nature of non-permissible income.</li>
  <li>Remain vigilant if Tesla Insurance activities expand, potentially increasing NPIN beyond current levels.</li>
  <li>Document purification methodology clearly for audit and stakeholder transparency.</li>
  <li>Be reassured that core business activities in technology, advertising, and AI remain fully permissible.</li>

<h2>2. Executive Summary</h2>
<p>
Tesla, Inc., traded on NASDAQ, is an automotive manufacturer engaged primarily in electric vehicles and energy products. The company underwent Shariah screening as of 22 October 2025 and ultimately received a <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong> verdict due to its exposure to non-permissible income sources.
</p>
<p>
Key financial ratios assessed include a debt ratio of 0.95%, a cash and investments ratio of 2.54%, and a non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio of 1.61% of total revenue. The estimated haram-sector revenue contribution is approximately 0.4% (with a range between 0.3% and 0.6%), primarily stemming from interest-based and investment income (riba). Although below the 5% NPIN threshold, the screening outcome was a failure. Purification of dividends or earnings at around 1.61% is recommended but not mandated.

<h3>Haram Segment Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Interest-based and investment income (riba):</strong> Income generated from interest-bearing deposits, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities held by Tesla’s treasury. Tesla does not engage in selling prohibited goods such as alcohol, gambling, pork, or weapons. The haram revenue contribution from interest income is estimated at 0.44% of total revenue, which is well below the 5% threshold for non-permissible income.</p>

<h2>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Summary of verdict:</strong> Although Tesla's financial ratios meet nominal thresholds, the presence of interest-based income, even at a low estimated level of ~0.44% of total revenue, results in a non-compliant Shariah screening outcome. The company is thus classified as non-compliant for Shariah investment purposes at this time.</p>

<h2>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The primary non-permissible income arises from riba on treasury cash, cash equivalents, and debt securities.</li>
  <li>Estimated haram revenue exposure is clearly below the 5% threshold commonly accepted in Shariah standards.</li>
  <li>Tesla's core automotive and energy businesses are considered neutral from Shariah perspective and classified as dual-use.</li>
  <li>Purification of dividends/earnings at approximately 1.61% is recommended to cleanse income from incidental haram elements.</li>
  <li>No additional involvement in prohibited industries or products is present.</li>
  <li>Monitoring should continue for any changes in treasury income composition or business activities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Holding Tesla, Inc. is permitted with the application of purification at an estimated 1.61% of distributable income.</li>
  <li>Given the non-compliance decision, managers should document and disclose purification methodology and rationale clearly to investors.</li>
  <li>Regular screening updates are advised, especially if treasury income disclosures evolve to provide more granular detail.</li>
  <li>Monitor for any emerging Shariah concerns, particularly changes in non-permissible income sources or business model.</li>
  <li>No immediate board review or additional restrictive action is deemed necessary according to current assessment.</li>

<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3>
<p>
Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) has been evaluated for Shariah compliance as of the reporting date October 30, 2025. The quantitative screening results show: debt ratio of 3.71%, cash and investments at 0.73%, and non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio at 4.87% of total revenue. The company's overall NPIN is estimated at approximately 4.5% of revenue (range 2.9%–5.9%), driven primarily by incidental revenue from alcohol retail sales (~2.0%), tobacco product sales (~1.8%), and pork product sales (~0.7%). Despite being below the 5% NPIN threshold, the screening status is a fail, resulting in a non-compliant classification. Purification of dividends by approximately 4.87% is recommended when holding this stock.

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Overall Verdict:</strong> <em>Non-Compliant</em></p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The company’s estimated non-permissible income stands at approximately 4.87%—just under the normative 5% threshold. However, the qualitative assessment identifies material exposure to impermissible sectors (alcohol, tobacco, pork) that are not core to its pharmaceutical operations. This results in a fail recommendation and non-compliant status according to Shariah equity screening guidelines.</p>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Exposure to alcohol retail sales (~2.0% revenue), non-permissible due to intoxicants.</li>
  <li>Tobacco product sales (~1.8% revenue), impermissible due to health harm and Shariah rulings.</li>
  <li>Pork product sales (~0.7% revenue), haram as pork is explicitly prohibited.</li>
  <li>Low leverage levels and minimal cash investments meet Shariah quantitative criteria.</li>
  <li>Pharmaceutical manufacturing is inherently permissible/neutral; non-permissible revenues are incidental.</li>
  <li>No purification process is recommended beyond dividend purification due to NPIN percentage.</li>
  <li>Board review or escalation is not required per current findings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Due to Eli Lilly and Company’s current Shariah screening fail status and non-compliant classification, holding this common stock requires purification of approximately 4.87% of dividends or earnings to cleanse non-permissible income. The key drivers of NPIN are incidental retail sales of alcohol, tobacco, and pork-related products embedded mainly through Walmart’s distribution channels. Portfolio managers should exercise caution and consider the impact of this purification on overall portfolio performance. Continued monitoring is recommended to detect any material changes in revenue composition or Shariah screening outcomes.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>
Walmart Inc. is classified as <strong>Non-Compliant</strong> in the current Shariah screening with a screening status of <em>FAIL</em>. The primary driver for non-compliance is riba-based interest income derived from treasury activities, which represents approximately 1.0% (range 0.9%–1.1%) of total revenue. Despite its core retail and membership activities being permissible, this non-permissible income exceeds the threshold for full compliance under Shariah screening rules.
</p>
<p>
Key financial ratios include a debt ratio of 6.53% and a cash and investment ratio of 0.98%, both within acceptable thresholds. The reported Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio stands at 0.09% of revenue, with a recommended purification ratio matching this amount.

<h3>Assessment Summary</h3>
<p>
Walmart Inc. generates non-permissible income predominantly via conventional (riba) interest from treasury operations, including bank deposits and interest-bearing securities. This income is clearly identified and quantified from the company’s GAAP non-operating income disclosures. No evidence was found indicating other haram revenue streams such as gambling, alcohol, conventional lending, insurance underwriting, or weapons manufacturing. Retail operations and membership activities, which constitute the core business, are considered permissible under Shariah.

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p>
<strong>Classification:</strong> NON-COMPLIANT<br>
Despite low overall NPIN ratios (0.09%), the haram-sector share of revenue, mainly interest income from conventional financial instruments, is estimated at approximately 1.0% of total revenue. This surpasses acceptable thresholds for full compliance under our screening parameters. Therefore, Walmart Inc. is deemed non-compliant with Shariah investment principles at this time.
</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Non-permissible income primarily originates from conventional interest (riba) earned on treasury cash and marketable securities.</li>
  <li>Retail operations and membership activities are considered permissible and do not contribute to non-compliance.</li>
  <li>The company involves a dual-use assessment where core business is permissible and only treasury operations generate haram income.</li>
  <li>No significant involvement in prohibited sectors such as gambling, alcohol, insurance underwriting, or weapons manufacturing detected.</li>
  <li>A caution flag was raised regarding the company’s launch of a conventional credit card product, but no direct interest income from this product is reported.</li>
  <li>Recommended purification of approximately 0.09% of distributable income is required if held in the portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>
Walmart Inc. may be held with caution in Shariah-compliant portfolios, subject to purification of dividends or distributable earnings at approximately 0.09% to cleanse the residual non-permissible income component. The company’s main risk arises from conventional interest accrued on treasury cash investments, which is below the 5% NPIN screening threshold but sufficient to cause an overall non-compliant classification due to the nature and persistence of this income. Continuous monitoring is advised, especially regarding any changes in treasury practices or expansions into financial products with high interest income exposure.
</p>
<p>
Portfolio managers should ensure that any investment in Walmart incorporates the recommended purification and that no increase in non-permissible income beyond current estimates occurs. Engagement with company disclosures on treasury operations may also help track changes in interest income composition.

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The overall Shariah verdict for Oracle Corporation is <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong> with a screening status of <strong>FAIL</strong>. The reported Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio stands at 1.01% of revenue, with an estimated haram-sector share of revenue at approximately 1.5% (range 1.3% – 1.9%). This primarily arises from conventional interest and investment income derived from riba-based sources. Although the company’s core business operations are fundamentally permissible, the presence of riba-based income leads to a non-compliant classification. Purification is currently applied at 1.01% of distributable income. Despite the non-compliance, the company is considered an allowed holding with recommended purification of dividends/earnings.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The estimated haram revenue exceeds internal Shariah screening tolerances despite passing quantitative checks, driven by riba-related investment income which cannot be mitigated without purification.</p>
<p><strong>Purification:</strong> Purification is currently applied at approximately 1.01% of distributable income. No additional purification percentage is recommended beyond current practice.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Shariah equity screening is aligned with the standard <em>5% NPIN threshold</em> for non-permissible income.</li>
  <li>Conventional interest income from cash investments and debt securities constitutes the primary source of haram revenue.</li>
  <li>Exposure to clients in haram sectors such as conventional banks and insurance companies exists but is limited to customer relationships and does not render Oracle’s core revenue haram.</li>
  <li>Oracle’s dual-use government-related contracts (e.g., with U.S. military entities) are noted but do not involve impermissible weapon manufacture or design.</li>
  <li>The company’s debt and cash investment ratios are within acceptable Shariah limits.</li>
  <li>Purification is recommended for dividends and earnings to cleanse residual NPIN impact.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Oracle Corporation is currently classified as a non-compliant stock due to riba-based income sources accounting for an estimated 1.5% of total revenue. Despite this, it remains an allowed holding within Shariah-compliant portfolios with appropriate purification applied at approximately 1.5% of dividends or earnings.</p>
<p>Portfolio managers should continue applying purification to dividend income to ensure compliance and monitor any potential increase in NPIN or haram revenue. No automatic banning is required, and the stock may be held with caution due to the moderate level of conventional interest income.</p>
<p>Continuous monitoring of Oracle’s financial disclosures and operational activities is recommended to identify any shifts in NPIN or business sectors that may impact the Shariah status.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,NON_COMPLIANT,"Oracle Corporation is classified as non-compliant due to approximately 1.5% of revenue from conventional interest income.

<h3>1. Executive Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Overall Shariah verdict:</strong> COMPLIANT WITH PURIFICATION<br>
<strong>Screening status:</strong> PASS WITH PURIFICATION<br>
The reported Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio stands at 4.15% of revenue. A purification ratio of 4.15% is currently applied to distributable income. The estimated share of revenue derived from haram sectors is approximately 0.7%, falling within a range of 0.5% to 1.0%. The main non-permissible revenue driver is interest and investment income considered riba-based (~0.7% of total revenue). All other screening metrics, including debt and cash & investments, are well within acceptable Shariah thresholds. No major qualitative concerns were flagged.</p>

<h3>4. Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>Estimated Haram Revenue Share:</strong> Approximately 0.7% of total revenue (range 0.5%–1.0%)</p>
<p><strong>Primary Haram Segment:</strong> Interest and investment income (riba)</p>
<p>This income arises primarily from non-operating activities such as holding cash equivalents and short-term instruments including money market funds, corporate and government debt securities, and time deposits/CDs. These interest-bearing financial assets generate returns classified as non-permissible under Shariah due to riba.</p>

</ol>

<h3>5. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>Johnson & Johnson is deemed <strong>Shariah-compliant with purification</strong>. Its non-permissible income, composed principally of riba-based earnings from passive interest and investment income, is below the 5% NPIN threshold established in Shariah guidelines. Accordingly, purification of dividends and earnings at approximately 0.7% is recommended before portfolio inclusion.</p>

<h3>6. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The company’s core activities in pharmaceuticals and healthcare are permissible.</li>
  <li>Non-operating interest income primarily from cash equivalents and short-term investments is the sole non-permissible source.</li>
  <li>The tangible debt level (7.48%) is within acceptable Shariah limits.</li>
  <li>The NPIN ratio (4.15%) requires purification but poses no significant compliance concern.</li>
  <li>No red-flag industries or significant qualitative concerns were identified.</li>
  <li>The purification recommendation aligns with accepted Shariah standards to avoid assisting in riba-based income.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>The holding of Johnson & Johnson is permitted with the application of purification on dividends and distributable income at an estimated rate of approximately 0.7%. Active monitoring of quarterly and annual disclosures relating to interest income is recommended to ensure continued compliance. No board review is required at this time. This company can be included in the portfolio with confidence, consistent with the firm’s Shariah compliance framework.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,Compliant with Purification,"Johnson & Johnson is Shariah compliant with purification.

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), operating in the semiconductor sector, has been assessed for Shariah compliance as of the reporting date 2025-11-04. The company has <em>failed</em> the Shariah screening primarily due to the presence of non-permissible income streams within its revenue, leading to a final Shariah classification of <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong>.</p>
<p>The reported NPIN ratio stands at 0.71%, with estimated haram-sector revenue approximately 0.2% of total revenue within a range of 0.1% to 0.3%. Although below the 5% NPIN threshold, the combined impact of specific non-permissible revenue segments requires cautious treatment. No purification of dividends is mandated; however, it is recommended to undertake ~0.22% purification if earnings are distributed.</p>
<p>Material haram income arises chiefly from interest income and non-operating finance income, profit-sharing from private-label credit card (PLCC) programs, and commissions on extended protection plans linked to third-party insurance products.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Overall Verdict:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Screening Status:</strong> FAIL</p>
<p>While AMD’s debt and NPIN metrics satisfy the standard quantitative thresholds, the presence of aggregated interest income and indirect profit-sharing linked to conventional credit and insurance products leads to a non-compliance conclusion.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The company’s semiconductor products and core business activities are permissible, with no evidence of direct involvement in prohibited sectors such as conventional banking, insurance, gambling, or arms manufacturing.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible revenue derives chiefly from residual interest income on cash holdings, profit-sharing from private-label credit card programs owned by third-party banks, and commissions on extended protection plans considered conventional insurance products.</li>
  <li>Interest income is considered riba and thus not permissible. Commissions on conventional insurance-related extended warranties are also non-permissible.</li>
  <li>The NPIN ratio remains within acceptable limits; however, aggregated financial income lines pose estimation uncertainties, warranting caution.</li>
  <li>Board review is recommended to confirm the exact split of ‘interest income and other, net’ and validate profit-sharing and commission estimates due to partial aggregation and lack of full disclosure.</li>
  <li>Dual-use assessment notes semiconductors as neutral infrastructure products with no inherent haram linkage in manufacturing but acknowledges clients in financial services sectors as a cautionary factor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. may be held with caution under Shariah-compliant portfolios given the low percentage of haram income (~0.22%). Purification of dividends and earnings by approximately 0.22% is recommended to offset the non-permissible income portion.</p>
<p>Due to flagged issues regarding the aggregation of interest income and indirect profit shares, it is advisable to await a board-level Shariah review where possible for final confirmatory guidance.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Screening Status:</strong> FAIL</p>
<p>The Home Depot, Inc. fails the overall Shariah compliance screening due primarily to interest income classified as non-permissible. The NPIN level, while well below the 5% threshold, still contributes to a non-compliance verdict due to the screening methodology and internal compliance parameters.</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Interest income on cash and short-term interest-bearing investments is the sole non-permissible income source.</li>
  <li>No involvement in alcohol, pork, gambling, weapons, or conventional financial services was identified.</li>
  <li>The company’s core business in home improvement is classified as dual-use/neutral for Shariah purposes.</li>
  <li>No evidence of other haram operating lines in FY2025 filings.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash ratios comply with Shariah thresholds, minimizing concerns related to leverage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>The holding of The Home Depot, Inc. is allowed with the condition that approximately 0.56% of dividends or earnings attributable to non-permissible income (interest) be purified. Investors should note the NON_COMPLIANT classification and apply the recommended purification accordingly. Continuous monitoring for any changes in income composition or sector involvement is advised to reassess compliance status.</p>

<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Procter & Gamble Company’s overall Shariah verdict is <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong> with a screening status of <em>FAIL</em>. The reported Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio is 0.56% of revenue, with an estimated haram-sector revenue share approximately 1.8% (range 1.6%–2.0%). The primary driver for non-permissible income is interest-based income (riba) related to cash/investments and financing activities. Although the NPIN is below the 5% threshold and no purification is mandated beyond the current 0.56% applied, the presence of interest income in the revenue composition results in the non-compliant classification. No other haram activities or sectors (such as alcohol, gambling, or conventional banking) were identified.</p>

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The key factor causing non-compliance is the presence of interest-based income comprising approximately 1.77% of total revenue, which, despite being below the 5% NPIN threshold, leads to failing the qualitative remediation required under Shariah guidelines. Purification is recommended and currently applied at 0.56% of distributable income, but this is insufficient to classify the stock as Shariah-compliant.</p>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Non-Permissible Income is predominantly derived from riba originating from treasury cash investments and financing lease interest.</li>
  <li>The debt ratio and NPIN ratio are within acceptable Shariah quantitative limits.</li>
  <li>No involvement in traditionally haram sectors such as alcohol, gambling, weapons manufacturing, or conventional banking products.</li>
  <li>Purification of dividends is recommended if invested in the stock, with the current purification ratio standing at 0.56% of distributable income.</li>
  <li>Dual-use considerations indicate consumer household & personal care products are neutral in Shariah terms; only incidental treasury interest income is non-permissible.</li>
  <li>Board review is not required for this company as per current assessment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>The Procter & Gamble Company is currently classified as non-compliant due to interest income constituting approximately 1.77% of its revenue. Portfolio managers are advised to <strong>allow holding</strong> with prudent application of purification on dividends and earnings at around 1.77%. Given the company’s stable financial ratios and the nature of its business, the investment is manageable from a risk perspective, assuming robust purification controls are maintained.</p>
<p>Portfolio teams should continue monitoring the company for any changes in non-permissible income sources or financial metrics that may impact compliance status. Additional care should be taken to ensure that purification procedures are consistently applied in accordance with Shariah standards.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,NON_COMPLIANT,The Procter & Gamble Company is non-compliant due to interest income making up about 1.77% of revenue.

Main haram-related drivers: Defense & Propulsion Technologies (DPT) – Military engines and related services (~27.0% of revenue).

LLM severity profile: max severity 2, avg severity 0.32. LLM rationale: LLM detected CAUTION in 5 chunk(s). Key themes: Chunk 6: The excerpt describes sales of general-purpose networking and AI infrastructure (routers, switches, servers, security) with public sector demand explicitly including U.S. Federal customers. These products are civilian in nature but are dual-use because governments (including defense agencies) can be customers; the chunk does not state the company is designing or selling weapons or battlefield systems.

Using the provided total revenue base of $38.702bn, this implies ~24–30% of total revenue is from DPT; we set a 27% point estimate. Under Shariah screening focused on the company’s own products, revenue from engines and services used on combat aircraft, military rotorcraft, tankers/transports, and naval gas turbines is treated as non‑permissible. We break DPT into equipment (original‑equipment engines) and services (spares, shop visits, TrueChoice Defense, training, support). Equipment/services split is anchored to disclosed 2025 YTD DPT mix (~48% equipment / ~52% services) and then allocated by platform family using industry knowledge of 2025 program activity (e.g., F110 IDIQ FMS award; rising F404/F414 units; sustained T700/T408 rotorcraft installed base). Totals are expressed as a percent of company revenue and sum to the segment estimate. On the 5% NPIN rule, the estimated total haram share (~27%) is clearly >5%, indicating non‑compliance on revenue screens despite a separate NPIN feed of 2.1% (likely based on a different methodology that does not classify core defense as non‑permissible)."",""limitations"":""GE does not disclose product‑level revenue within DPT.

Q1–Q3 quarterly DPT revenue of ~$2.3bn, ~$2.6bn, and ~$2.8bn indicates an annualized DPT run‑rate of roughly $10–11bn. Using the provided total revenue base of $38.702bn, this implies ~24–30% of total revenue is from DPT; we set a 27% point estimate. Under Shariah screening focused on the company’s own products, revenue from engines and services used on combat aircraft, military rotorcraft, tankers/transports, and naval gas turbines is treated as non‑permissible. We break DPT into equipment (original‑equipment engines) and services (spares, shop visits, TrueChoice Defense, training, support). Equipment/services split is anchored to disclosed 2025 YTD DPT mix (~48% equipment / ~52% services) and then allocated by platform family using industry knowledge of 2025 program activity (e.g., F110 IDIQ FMS award; rising F404/F414 units; sustained T700/T408 rotorcraft installed base). Totals are expressed as a percent of company revenue and sum to the segment estimate.

<hr>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Cisco Systems, Inc. has been assessed under Shariah compliance screening and has failed due to non-permissible revenue exceeding the accepted threshold. Key financial indicators show a debt ratio of 9.46%, cash and investments ratio of 7.7%, and a Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio of 1.77%, which is within the acceptable 5% limit. However, an estimated ≈ 27.0% of the company's revenue derives from non-permissible activities related primarily to Defense & Propulsion Technologies (DPT), notably military engines and related services, which surpasses the Shariah permissible limits.</p>
<p>Despite a low NPIN ratio allowing no immediate purification requirement, the significant exposure to the defense segment results in an overall non-compliance verdict. Portfolio managers are advised to avoid new investments in Cisco Systems at this time due to the current Shariah screening failure.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>Although Cisco Systems meets the financial ratio screens for debt and NPIN ratios, the estimated 27% revenue from its Defense & Propulsion Technologies segment is substantially above the accepted 5% threshold for non-permissible income. Consequently, the company does not pass the Shariah screening on the revenue basis.</p>
<p>Purification is not applicable as NPIN is below 5%; however, the presence of a core defense segment drives the final non-compliance decision.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Primary source of non-permissible income is from direct sales and services supporting military engines and platforms used in combat and defense.</li>
  <li>The company’s networking and AI infrastructure products, including sales to government and sovereign customers, pose dual-use considerations but do not generate clear non-permissible income.</li>
  <li>No significant prohibited interest income or ambiguous revenue sources detected requiring purification advisory.</li>
  <li>The 5% NPIN allowance applies, but the overall non-permissible sector revenue proportion surpasses acceptable limits.</li>
  <li>Shariah screening prioritizes avoiding investment in companies facilitating military weapons platforms, which governs the non-compliance decision.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid new investments in Cisco Systems, Inc. due to its current non-compliant status under Shariah screening criteria.</li>
  <li>Monitor company disclosures for any material reduction in the defense-related revenue segment or restructuring that might improve compliance.</li>
  <li>Note that no purification is required at this time as NPIN is within allowable limits, but overall portfolio exposure to defense-related companies should be carefully managed.</li>
  <li>Review ongoing developments related to dual-use government contracts and ensure cautious evaluation of related product sales.</li>
  <li>Keep abreast of any updated Shariah rulings or clarifications regarding dual-use technology and government-related revenues.</li>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>GE Aerospace is screened under Islamic finance principles and passes with purification required for its non-permissible income components. The company’s overall debt and cash investment ratios comply with Shariah limits (<33%). The Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio stands at 2.1%, which is below the 5% threshold set by Shariah standards.</p>
<p>The primary source of haram income arises from interest-based finance and treasury income amounting to approximately 0.26% of total revenue, requiring a purification of dividends or distributable income by the same proportion. However, there are qualitative flags related to the company’s significant involvement in core defense activities, considered non-permissible under Islamic finance. These conflicting signals necessitate further review by the Shariah supervisory board before final approval.</p>
<p>Pending board review, portfolio managers are advised to hold or avoid new investments despite the pass with purification status.</p>

<h3>Haram Sector Flags</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Core defense sector involvement linked to defense propulsion and mission-critical technologies is categorized as non-permissible.</li>
  <li>Although commercial aerospace activity exists, the company’s defense revenue streams and growth in defense units indicate direct participation in a non-permissible business line.</li>
  <li>Some dual-use aerospace components carry caution flags but are not considered outright haram on their own.</li>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT_WITH_PURIFICATION</p>
<p><strong>Screening Status:</strong> PASS_WITH_PURIFICATION</p>
<p>The company complies with the quantitative thresholds for debt, cash investment, and NPIN ratios. The purification required is approximately 2.1% of distributable income to offset the haram portion primarily from interest income.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the significant involvement in core defense manufacturing and propulsion systems is non-permissible under Shariah. These qualitative defense-related flags create ambiguity, requiring a thorough review and final decision by the Shariah board before full approval can be considered.</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Non-permissible income mainly arises from riba-based interest from treasury operations and cash asset management.</li>
  <li>Core defense business activities producing arms and military propulsion systems are categorically non-permissible.</li>
  <li>The company operates dual-use technologies, some overlapping civilian and defense applications, necessitating caution.</li>
  <li>Current data inconsistencies and mapping issues between GE Aerospace and referenced Chevron filings warrant careful validation.</li>
  <li>Purification of dividends/distributable income at the ratio of 2.1% is mandatory for compliant investment participation.</li>
  <li>Pending approval from the Shariah supervisory board is required due to defense sector concerns and quality assurance issues detected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The holding is currently allowed subject to purification of approximately 0.26% of dividends/earnings to cleanse non-permissible income.</li>
  <li>Due to the conflicting defense-related flags and upstream data inconsistencies, it is recommended to HOLD or AVOID initiating new positions until the Shariah board completes its review.</li>
  <li>Monitor updates for the Shariah board’s final verdict and ensure purification processes are strictly followed during dividend distribution.</li>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>Chevron Corporation fails the Shariah compliance screening primarily due to a substantial proportion of revenue derived from conventional health insurance premiums and non-permissible interest income. Despite passing quantitative ratio limits, the nature of the core business segments leads to non-compliance.</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Conventional insurance business models involve gharar (excessive uncertainty), maisir (gambling), and riba (interest), rendering related revenue haram.</li>
  <li>Interest income from investment and other financial activities constitutes riba and is fully non-permissible.</li>
  <li>Purification is not recommended given the overwhelming proportion of haram revenue (~72.8%).</li>
  <li>Company is not considered dual-use or neutral; majority of revenues are core-haram.</li>
  <li>Debt levels and NPIN percentages meet standard screening thresholds but do not override the dominant haram income streams.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>It is recommended to <strong>avoid new investments</strong> in Chevron Corporation due to its <strong>non-compliance</strong> with Shariah screening criteria, specifically the high share of conventional insurance-related revenue and riba income. Current holdings should be reviewed in line with firm policy and Shariah Board guidance.</p>
<p>No purification is advised given the dominant haram revenue composition. Portfolio managers should monitor any changes in business model or disclosure that might affect compliance status and reassess accordingly.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,Non-Compliant,"Chevron Corporation is non-compliant with Shariah screening due to substantial revenue from conventional health insurance premiums and interest income, accounting for approximately 72.8% of total revenue.",Purification is not advised owing to the high proportion of non-permissible income (~72.8%).,"[""Over 70% of revenue comes from conventional health insurance premiums, which are non-permissible."",""Interest income accounts for about 1.3% of revenue and is also non-permissible."",""Debt and cash investment ratios meet screening limits."",""Due to the dominant non-permissible income, avoid new investments in Chevron.""]","[{""name"":""UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement (insured premiums incl.

IBM’s filings state the segment includes financing solutions and used equipment sales; quarterlies indicate revenue changes were primarily driven by used equipment sales, confirming the mix. Historical 2019–2020 filings quantified used‑equipment at ~40–48% of segment revenue; with IBM’s 2024 commentary showing declines driven by used equipment, we infer the financing (interest/fee) portion is the majority in 2024. We therefore estimate 50–80% of the $713m is interest/fees (haram), yielding 0.57–0.91% of total revenue; point 0.74%. Under Shariah rules, conventional interest income is non‑permissible, while technology sales to haram‑sector clients are allowed (dual‑use). Total haram across all segments (including non‑operating interest; see next segment) is estimated at ~1.8% of revenue in FY2024, comfortably below the 5% NPIN threshold.

<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3>
<p>
UnitedHealth Group Incorporated fails the Shariah screening primarily due to its core involvement in conventional health insurance and managed care operations, which are non-permissible. While the non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio stands at a low 1.04% of total revenue, the company’s fundamental business model involves conventional insurance products that generate gharar, maisir, and riba concerns. The estimated haram-sector share of revenue is approximately 1.8%, falling below the 5% NPIN threshold; thus, purification is not mandatory. Key non-permissible income drivers are primarily related to interest income on treasury cash and investments and conventional financing activities.

<h3>5. Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>
Estimated haram revenue stands at approximately 1.8% of total revenue, within a range of 1.2% to 2.4%. The main contributors to non-permissible income include non-operating interest income from treasury cash and investments and conventional financing activities related to loans and fees. The company’s conventional health insurance operations also render the core business non-compliant despite the relatively low NPIN ratio.

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>
<strong>Overall Verdict:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT<br/>
Despite the low level of non-permissible income by percentage of total revenue, UnitedHealth Group’s core operations are in conventional health insurance and managed care, which are prohibited sectors under Shariah due to elements of uncertainty (gharar), gambling (maisir), and interest (riba). Therefore, the company fails the Shariah screening.
</p>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Core business involves conventional health insurance plans including Medicare Advantage, commercial fully insured plans, ACA offerings, and employer insurance products.</li>
  <li>Conventional insurance operations inherently involve gharar, maisir, and riba, rendering the business model non-permissible.</li>
  <li>Non-operating interest income derived from treasury cash and investments contributes to non-permissible income.</li>
  <li>Conventional financing activities generate additional interest and fee income that is non-permissible.</li>
  <li>Reported NPIN ratio of 1.04% is below the 5% threshold, but the prohibited sector classification dominates the final compliance decision.</li>
  <li>No purification is required based on the reported NPIN and company business model assessment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>
UnitedHealth Group is classified as a non-compliant security under Shariah due to its foundational business in conventional health insurance and related non-permissible practices. Although the estimated non-permissible income share is approximately 1.8%, purification of dividends or earnings at this level is noted but may not align with accepted Shariah standards given the core prohibited sector nature. Portfolio managers should carefully consider exclusion or avoidance of this holding in fully Shariah-compliant portfolios. Where held, appropriate client disclosures and purification mechanisms should be applied.

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT_WITH_PURIFICATION</p>
<p>IBM satisfies all key Shariah quantitative and qualitative criteria, passing the screening with purification required on the identified non-permissible income portion only. The recommended purification is approximately 1.33% of total revenue, corresponding to the interest income component. This approach aligns with the common Shariah equity standards allowing a limited NPIN tolerance level (up to 5%) with purification measures.</p>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The only identified haram income is conventional interest on liquid assets, constituting ~1.33% of revenue.</li>
  <li>The company operates in the information technology services sector, providing general-purpose technological solutions with no inherent non-permissible business lines.</li>
  <li>IBM’s involvement with financial institution clients is limited to technology provision and does not generate direct interest income or haram revenue streams.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash ratios remain within accepted Shariah screening limits.</li>
  <li>The purification requirement is limited to the measured non-permissible interest income portion and is manageable through dividend purification.</li>
  <li>Due to some exposure to clients in conventional financial and insurance industries and dual-use technology caution, monitoring is advisable but no direct Shariah breach is evident in IBM’s own revenue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>IBM is deemed an allowed holding under Shariah-compliant investment guidelines with a purification ratio of approximately 1.33% of dividends or distributable income. Portfolio managers should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement purification procedures on distributable earnings corresponding to the NPIN ratio of 3.23% and the haram revenue point estimate of 1.33%.</li>
  <li>Continue monitoring company disclosures for any material changes in non-permissible income sources, particularly conventional interest income from investments.</li>
  <li>Note that IBM’s business model is primarily within permissible sectors despite providing technology services to some conventional finance sector clients.</li>
  <li>Maintain awareness of dual-use technology risks and consult Shariah advisors if new product lines or business partnerships emerge that may impact permissibility.</li>
  <li>Consider re-screening if company financials indicate significant deviation in NPIN, debt, or cash ratios exceeding thresholds.</li>

<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3>
<p>
Micron Technology, Inc. is classified as <strong>Non-Compliant</strong> based on Shariah screening criteria, primarily due to its involvement in Financial Products generating interest and conventional insurance income. The estimated non-permissible revenue is approximately 4.7% of total revenue, with a range from 4.1% to 5.3%, placing it close to the 5% threshold for non-permissible income (NPIN). Despite the NPIN reported at 1.33%, and a purification applied at the same level, the total haram exposure on revenue exceeds the threshold in its upper estimate and is sufficiently material to warrant a fail status.
</p>
<p>
There are no major operational Shariah issues within Micron’s core semiconductor business, which is considered dual-use or neutral infrastructure. The haram exposure arises exclusively from a minor revenue segment related to Financial Products and Insurance Services, including interest-bearing finance and conventional insurance.

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Overall Verdict:</strong> <em>NON_COMPLIANT</em></p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong> Although the reported NPIN ratio of 1.33% is below the 5% threshold, the estimated haram revenue exposure of approximately 4.7% (point estimate) is near the limit and could exceed it on the upper bound (up to 5.3%). This combined with minor QA issues and the nature of financial product income results in a FAIL screening status. Purification at the reported NPIN ratio is applied, but not sufficient to resolve compliance fully given the close proximity to the threshold and the materiality of haram sources.</p>

<hr>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Primary non-compliant revenue arises from interest-based retail and wholesale finance provided by Cat Financial and the associated conventional insurance segment.</li>
  <li>Operating lease rentals within the Financial Products segment are excluded from non-permissible calculations and treated as halal rental income.</li>
  <li>Micron’s core semiconductor manufacturing and product offerings are dual-use/neutral infrastructure with no direct Shariah compliance issues.</li>
  <li>Reported NPIN is well-calculated but estimates on certain revenue components (e.g., Insurance Services revenue and ‘other’ finance income) involve assumptions and conservative factors.</li>
  <li>Though close to the 5% NPIN threshold, the upper bound of the haram revenue range surpasses this limit, supporting the fail classification.</li>
  <li>Purification of dividends/earnings at ~4.7% is recommended due to the non-negligible haram exposure.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>
Holdings in Micron Technology, Inc. should be monitored carefully given the borderline NPIN and fail screening status. The position is allowed with the application of purification at approximately 4.7% of dividends or distributable earnings, consistent with the company’s estimated non-permissible income exposure.
</p>
<p>
Portfolio managers should be aware that the NPIN figure reported at 1.33% reflects purification already applied, but the full haram revenue estimate is higher and may vary due to assumptions in segment revenue splits. Close attention to updates in segment disclosures, especially regarding Financial Products and Insurance Services, is advised to review purification ratios and compliance status.
</p>
<p>
No board review or escalation is presently required. However, the exposure to conventional banking-related financial segments remains a key red flag. Replacement strategy should consider alternatives with clear pass status if client mandates are strict on NPIN limits.

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Caterpillar Inc. has been evaluated for Shariah compliance based on its financial and business activities as of the reporting date October 29, 2025. The company fails the Shariah screening primarily due to significant revenue derived from interest-based income and penalty-related fees associated with conventional lending practices. The estimated share of non-permissible (haram) revenue is approximately 26.3%, well above the 5% threshold for permissible non-permissible income (NPIN) in Shariah screening. Despite compliance on quantitative thresholds such as debt ratios and NPIN percentage, the material presence of riba-based income and related fees renders the overall business non-compliant.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The company is deemed non-compliant due to a substantial proportion of revenue generated from impermissible sources, primarily interest-based income and related penalty fees integrated into its financial products. Given the total non-permissible income far exceeds the 5% threshold, the company fails the overall Shariah compliance screening despite passing quantitative debt and NPIN ratio checks.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The core issue remains the substantial interest (riba) income from revolving credit and other interest-bearing financial assets, which are strictly non-permissible under Islamic finance principles.</li>
  <li>Penalty fees related to late payments and cash advances are also considered haram as they stem from conventional credit practices involving riba.</li>
  <li>While the company’s primary agricultural machinery business may be operational or dual-use, the large impact of financial products related to conventional lending dictates overall non-compliance.</li>
  <li>Quantitative NPIN of 0.74% is reported, but material haram revenue is embedded in business activities classified under non-permissible sectors.</li>
  <li>The company does not require purification currently due to NPIN levels; however, investment avoidance is advised due to the high haram revenue content.</li>
  <li>Shariah references emphasize the 5% NPIN threshold and the prohibition against assisting in prohibited activities (ta’awun ‘ala al-ithm), reinforcing the non-compliance status.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid new investments in Caterpillar Inc. due to its failure in Shariah compliance screening.</li>
  <li>Consider existing exposure carefully, given the substantial non-permissible income portion.</li>
  <li>No purification is currently recommended; however, ongoing monitoring for changes in financial product mix and revenue composition is necessary.</li>
  <li>Review alternative investment opportunities that comply fully with Shariah principles to maintain portfolio integrity.</li>
  <li>Note that this report indicates QA issues unrelated to Shariah compliance but relevant for overall data integrity; exercise caution in data interpretation.</li>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The Shariah screening of American Express Company resulted in a <strong>FAIL</strong> status with a final classification of <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong>. The key quantitative drivers are a reported non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio of 32.07% and an estimated haram-sector share of revenue at approximately 0.7% (range 0.4%–0.9%). The main source of haram income is identified as non-operating finance income comprising interest, investment and derivative gains. The company operates a conventional financial services business centered on credit card issuance and conventional consumer finance, which are inherently non-permissible under Shariah law. Purification of approximately 0.65% of distributable income is likely recommended.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> FAIL</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The company’s core business as a conventional consumer finance and credit card issuer inherently violates Shariah principles due to the reliance on interest-based financial services. Despite the estimated haram revenue share being below the 5% threshold, the structural nature of its business results in a non-compliant verdict.</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Core business model involves conventional lending and credit card issuance which is non-permissible.</li>
  <li>High NPIN ratio of 32.07% indicates substantial presence of non-permissible income components.</li>
  <li>Haram income primarily stems from interest, conventional investment gains/dividends, and derivative hedging instruments.</li>
  <li>Cash and investments ratio significantly exceeds the Shariah threshold, indicating potential risk of further riba income.</li>
  <li>The company is flagged multiple times for conventional banking activities and interest income cores.</li>
  <li>Purification is advised around 0.65% of distributable income to compensate for non-permissible earnings identified.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>American Express Company is currently classified as non-compliant with major Shariah concerns related to its interest-based conventional financial services and credit card business. The company may be held conditionally with purification recommended on roughly 0.65% of distributable dividend or earnings. Portfolio managers should carefully consider the elevated NPIN, cash holdings, and structural violations when deciding on inclusion. A formal Shariah board review is advised to reconcile conflicting NPIN and interest figures flagged during upstream screening. Until such review, a cautious hold or avoid stance is prudent to maintain Shariah integrity of portfolios.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,NON_COMPLIANT,"American Express is non-compliant due to its conventional credit card business and high interest-based income, despite low haram revenue under 1%.

<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Merck &amp; Co., Inc. has been assessed for Shariah compliance for the fiscal period ending October 30, 2025. The company’s total non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio is 0.65% of revenue, with a haram revenue estimate approximately 1.3% (range: 1.1% to 1.4%). The primary source of non-permissible income is conventional interest on cash and cash equivalents. Despite the NPIN being below the 5% purification threshold, the overall screening status is a fail, leading to a final classification of non-compliant. Purification of the dividends/earnings is recommended to account for the incidental riba income.</p>

<h4>Summary of Haram Segment</h4>
<p>The non-permissible income is exclusively derived from conventional interest earned on cash and cash equivalent holdings such as money market funds, bank time deposits, and other interest-bearing bank balances. This constitutes approximately 1.25% of total revenue, well below the 5% NPIN threshold allowing the company to be held with required purification measures.</p>

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Although the NPIN ratio (0.65%) is below the 5% threshold, the combined estimated non-permissible revenue contribution of approximately 1.25% from conventional interest income mandates purification. The company fails the overall Shariah compliance screening due to the presence of incidental riba-based income from cash management activities.</p>
<p><strong>Screening Status:</strong> FAIL</p>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Non-permissible income arises exclusively from incidental conventional interest on cash and cash equivalents.</li>
  <li>The company does not engage in inherently haram business activities or sectors.</li>
  <li>The level of non-permissible income requires purification but remains below maximum threshold limits.</li>
  <li>No additional material Shariah concerns or operational flags were identified.</li>
  <li>The pharmaceutical operations remain fully permissible and neutral from a Shariah perspective.</li>
  <li>Shariah references applicable include the 5% NPIN threshold and avoidance of assisting in sin (ta’awun ‘ala al-ithm).</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>The holding of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. is permitted with the condition of purification of dividends/earnings to account for the estimated 1.25% non-permissible income related to conventional interest. Portfolio managers should ensure that such purification is rigorously applied in accordance with Islamic finance principles. There is no indication of any direct involvement in haram sectors aside from incidental interest income, and the overall operational activities are consistent with Shariah compliance requirements.</p>
<p>It is recommended to periodically review the cash management strategies impacting interest income to monitor any material changes to NPIN levels and reassess purification needs accordingly.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,Non-Compliant,"Merck & Co., Inc. is non-compliant due to approximately 1.3% of its revenue from conventional interest income, requiring purification despite all other financial ratios passing Shariah criteria.",Purify approximately 1.25% of dividends/earnings related to conventional interest income on cash holdings.,"[""Primary business in pharmaceuticals is fully permissible under Shariah."",""Non-permissible income (~1.3%) arises only from interest on cash and equivalents."",""Total non-permissible income is below 5% but requires purification."",""No involvement in haram sectors such as alcohol, gambling, or weapons."",""Purification should be applied consistently and reviewed regularly.""]","[{""name"":""Interest from money market funds (cash-equivalent funds)"",""pct_of_total_revenue"":0.75,""why"":""Income arises from conventional interest-bearing instruments held within money market funds; riba income is non-permissible and requires purification."",""source_note"":""Company filings""},{""name"":""Interest from bank time deposits and short-term deposits"",""pct_of_total_revenue"":0.45,""why"":""Conventional time deposits pay interest; such riba-based returns are non-permissible and must be purified."",""source_note"":""Company filings""},{""name"":""Other interest (interest-bearing bank balances, tax interest, misc.)"",""pct_of_total_revenue"":0.05,""why"":""Residual conventional interest not captured above is treated as riba and purified."",""source_note"":""Company filings""}]",Estimated interest income split is based on company filings but exact figures may fluctuate within the year.,This assessment reflects current data and may change as new information becomes available.

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Lam Research Corporation (""Lam Research""), a company operating in the semiconductors sector, has been evaluated for Shariah compliance. Despite meeting key quantitative financial ratios (debt, cash & investments, non-permissible income), the company <strong>fails</strong> the overall Shariah screening due to earnings from non-permissible interest income. The estimated non-compliant revenue portion is approximately 2.5% (range: 1.8%–3.0%) derived primarily from non-operating interest and finance income.</p>
<p>This results in a final Shariah verdict of <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong>, requiring purification of dividends at about 2.51%. The company’s core semiconductor equipment business, considered neutral or permissible under dual-use assessment, is free from haram involvement.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Overall Screening Status:</strong> <span style=""color: red; font-weight: bold;"">FAIL</span></p>
<p><strong>Final Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Haram Revenue Portion:</strong> ≈ 2.51% (range: 1.8% – 3.0%)</p>
<p><strong>Purification Required:</strong> No mandatory purification percentage prescribed, though portfolio-level purification of dividends/earnings recommended at approximately 2.51% due to non-operating interest income.</p>
<hr/>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Non-permissible income mainly stems from riba (interest) earned on cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and customer financing/leases.</li>
  <li>The company’s core semiconductor equipment business is permissible and considered dual-use technology, thus not haram.</li>
  <li>Total non-compliant income is under 5% NPIN threshold, allowing continued holding with appropriate purification.</li>
  <li>Uncertainty exists due to incomplete breakdown of interest income sources and minor customer financing revenue.</li>
  <li>No major concerns related to assisting in sin or transgression were identified.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash ratios fall well within acceptable Shariah limits.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Lam Research Corporation is classified as a non-compliant stock due to its non-permissible earnings from interest income. However, the total non-compliant revenue portion is below the 5% threshold, and the company does not engage in haram operational business lines.</p>
<p>Portfolio managers may continue to hold or initiate positions with the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply a purification ratio approximating 2.51% on dividends or earnings derived from Lam Research holdings.</li>
  <li>Monitor quarterly disclosures for any significant changes in non-operating income streams or financing activities that could affect Shariah status.</li>
  <li>Ensure transparency in reporting and readiness to reassess if material lease or financing revenue grows.</li>

<p><strong>Key Drivers:</strong> The sole haram segment identified is the non-operating interest and investment income amounting to approximately 0.82% of total revenue. There are no haram product lines such as alcohol, gambling, or conventional financial services. Medical, diagnostics, and related business segments are fully permissible.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>
The overall classification is <strong>COMPLIANT_WITH_PURIFICATION</strong>. Although non-permissible income exists at approximately 0.82% of total revenue, this is well below the 5% NPIN threshold, and hence the company passes the purity requirements of Shariah screening. The recommended purification ratio, applied to distributable income such as dividends, is <strong>0.82%</strong>. There are no concerns relating to haram product involvement or other prohibitive activities.
</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The sole source of haram income is non-operating interest income derived from conventional financial instruments, which is considered riba.</li>
  <li>Business segments in diagnostics, medical devices, and research are deemed permissible and free from Shariah violations.</li>
  <li>The debt level of 14.94% is within acceptable Shariah limits.</li>
  <li>Cash and investment holdings amount to 2.79%, also within compliance limits.</li>
  <li>Purification of dividends is mandatory based on calculated NPIN and haram revenue exposure.</li>
  <li>No evidence of involvement in prohibited industries or activities, strengthening the compliance profile.</li>
  <li>Dual-use assessment confirms a neutral stance with no adverse Shariah implications except for the isolated interest income.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is approved for inclusion in Shariah-compliant portfolios subject to a purification of approximately 0.82% of dividends or distributable earnings to cleanse non-permissible income. Portfolio managers should continue monitoring any material movements in non-operating interest income or potential changes in business activities that may affect Shariah compliance. There are no red flags or material concerns that preclude holding this stock within Islamic funds. The company’s sound compliance with debt and liquidity thresholds, combined with its permissible primary business operations, make it a suitable investment with purification applied.

<h3>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p>The only identified haram component in Abbott Laboratories' revenue stems from minor interest and treasury income, estimated at approximately 0.82% of total revenue. This revenue source is derived primarily from conventional interest-bearing investments and is within the permissible purification threshold.</p>
<p>Abbott Laboratories does not generate revenue from commonly prohibited sectors such as conventional lending or insurance, alcohol, pork production or retail, gambling, or defense manufacturing. The company’s core business activities relating to medical devices, diagnostics, nutrition, and branded generics are considered permissible under the dual-use infrastructure principle, although Abbott is not classified as a dual-use firm in this context.</p>
<p>Purification is recommended for approximately 0.82% of distributable income/dividends attributable to shareholders.</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> COMPLIANT</p>
<p>Abbott Laboratories meets all relevant Shariah compliance criteria, including quantitative financial ratio thresholds and sector activity restrictions. No purification beyond the minor NPIN component is required to uphold compliance. This verdict is supported by a thorough quality assurance review and final classification status marked as compliant.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No identified involvement in prohibited sectors or activities.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash plus investment ratios significantly below maximum permissible limits.</li>
  <li>Non-permissible income derived solely from minor interest income at 0.82%.</li>
  <li>Purification aligned with NPIN to maintain shareholder compliance.</li>
  <li>Shariah screening status: PASS with no outstanding concerns.</li>
  <li>Quality assurance confirms no material non-permissible indicators.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Portfolio managers may continue to hold Abbott Laboratories as a Shariah-compliant investment given the company’s adherence to all screening criteria. It is advisable to purify roughly 0.82% of dividends or distributable income periodically to maintain Shariah purity. Continuous monitoring of the company's financial disclosures is recommended to ensure that NPIN stays below the 5% threshold and that no new non-compliant activities emerge.</p>

<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Visa Inc. has passed the initial quantitative Shariah screening with no material non-permissible income identified. The reported Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) ratio is 0.00%, and current purification is not deemed necessary. Debt and cash/investment ratios are well within permissible thresholds at 3.75% and 3.43%, respectively. However, due to a lack of reliable data on non-compliant revenue percentages and incomplete identification of haram revenue segments, the company’s Shariah compliance stands classified as <em>DOUBTFUL_REVIEW</em>. A thorough board review is required to confirm revenue composition and any potential exposure to core-haram merchant categories before a final endorsement can be provided. Portfolio managers are advised to hold or avoid until this review is completed.</p>

<p>Composition detail: N/A (not provided).</p>

<p><strong>Haram Segments:</strong> None identified in the data provided.</p>

<p><strong>Dual Use Assessment:</strong> Payment network and fintech infrastructure are generally dual-use and not inherently haram; no core-haram activities were identified in the provided data.</p>

<p><strong>Shariah References for Assessment:</strong></p>

  <li>[1] 5% NPIN threshold for non-permissible income in Shariah screening.</li>
  <li>[2] Avoiding assisting in sin and transgression (ta’awun ‘ala al-ithm).</li>
  <li>[3] Avoiding doubtful matters when information is incomplete or ambiguous.</li>
</ol>

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> <em>DOUBTFUL_REVIEW</em></p>
<p>The final verdict reflects uncertainty due to insufficient data on haram revenue percentages and inability to confirm that non-compliant revenue is below the 5% threshold. Despite passing quantitative metrics, the absence of reliable estimates and potential borderline concerns require a Shariah board review to ascertain full compliance. Until such review, the company's status remains tentative.</p>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Zero reported NPIN ratio indicating no directly identified impermissible income streams.</li>
  <li>Low debt and cash/investment ratios within permissible limits.</li>
  <li>Absence of provided haram revenue composition or segment-level haram breakdown.</li>
  <li>Potential dual-use nature of payment and fintech infrastructure is not considered inherently haram.</li>
  <li>Need for board confirmation of revenue composition and identification of any core-haram merchant exposures.</li>
  <li>Awareness of quality assurance issues flagged in the screening data requiring resolution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>It is recommended to <strong>hold or avoid adding Visa Inc. to Shariah-compliant portfolios until a formal Shariah board review is completed</strong>. The review should focus on clarifying any exposures to potentially non-compliant revenue streams and confirm that non-permissible income does not exceed the acceptable threshold. Portfolio managers should monitor updates from the Shariah board carefully and avoid trading decisions based solely on current incomplete data. Once the board issues a definitive ruling, further portfolio action can be taken accordingly.</p>",,,FALSE,PASS,None,PASS — No auto-ban conditions triggered,Doubtful - Pending Board Review,"Visa Inc. passes initial financial criteria with no direct impermissible income reported, but incomplete data on non-compliant revenue requires board review before final Shariah clearance.",No purification currently required due to zero reported non-permissible income.,"[""No directly identified impermissible income streams; NPIN ratio at 0.00%."",""Debt and cash/investment levels comfortably within Shariah limits."",""Haram revenue composition not provided, preventing full compliance confirmation."",""Payment services generally acceptable; no core haram sectors detected so far."",""Board review essential to confirm revenue sources and exposures before approval.""]",[],Uncertainty remains due to missing reliable data on non-compliant revenues and flagged data quality issues.,This screening is based on available data and may change after further Shariah review.

<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3>
<p>T-Mobile US, Inc. was evaluated for Shariah compliance with a focus on its financial ratios and business activities. The company failed the overall Shariah screening primarily due to a high debt ratio of 52.36%, exceeding the permissible maximum of 33%. The reported non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio stands at 0.00%, and no purification is currently recommended. Although the telecommunications sector is generally considered a dual-use/neutral infrastructure business with mostly permissible core services, certain ancillary services such as device financing, content, and payment services require further scrutiny.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of reliable estimates for non-compliant revenue and no detailed haram segments identified, a board review is advised to clarify any potential non-permissible revenue and to finalize the classification. Portfolio managers are advised to hold or avoid investing in this security pending the Shariah board's definitive review.</p>

<h3>5. Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p><em>Dual Use and Ancillary Business Lines:</em> Telecommunications is a dual-use and neutral infrastructure business. The core services provided by T-Mobile US, Inc. are generally considered permissible. However, ancillary operations such as device financing, content services, and payment services may generate non-permissible income and should be thoroughly assessed.</p>

<p><strong>Haram Revenue Composition:</strong></p>
<p>Composition detail: N/A (not provided).</p>

<p><strong>Haram Segments:</strong></p>
<p>None identified or disclosed.</p>

<p><strong>References:</strong></p>
<p>None provided.</p>

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The company's debt ratio exceeds the accepted limit, leading to a failed numeric screening. Although NPIN is reported as zero, the lack of detailed data on potential ancillary non-permissible income, and invalid or missing operational figures, necessitates a conservative classification of non-compliance at this time. A dedicated Shariah board review is strongly recommended to resolve outstanding uncertainties.</p>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The company's debt ratio of 52.36% surpasses the maximum allowable limit of 33%, which is a critical financial non-compliance issue.</li>
  <li>No NPIN has been detected; however, insufficient data prevents a full analysis of potentially non-permissible ancillary services.</li>
  <li>Telecommunications is a dual-use sector with permissible core services but requiring close monitoring of ancillary businesses.</li>
  <li>Screening encountered quality assurance (QA) issues including invalid unidentified non-operating figures, further complicating assessment accuracy.</li>
  <li>In the absence of purification recommendations, focus remains on preventing investment exposure until clarifications are obtained.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>

<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Salesforce, Inc. has passed the numerical Shariah compliance screening thresholds with a debt ratio of 4.54% (below the 33% threshold), cash and investments at 7.53% (also below 33%), and zero reported non-permissible income (NPIN). However, the final Shariah verdict is classified as <strong>DOUBTFUL_REVIEW</strong> due to the absence of a reliable estimate of non-compliant revenue and lack of segment-level details on potentially haram activities. The Shariah board is recommended to review this case to confirm the absence of ancillary or third-party revenue streams that might be non-permissible. No purification is currently required or recommended. Portfolio managers should hold or avoid positions pending board confirmation because of the borderline and uncertain status.</p>

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Verdict Status:</strong> DOUBTFUL_REVIEW</p>
<p>While numerical screening passes all thresholds, the lack of detailed non-permissible income data and segment transparency prevents issuing a clear Shariah compliance verdict at this time. A Shariah board review is necessary to resolve ambiguities and confirm no hidden non-permissible activities exist.</p>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reported Non-Permissible Income is 0.00%, within acceptable limits.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash/investment ratios remain comfortably below Shariah screening thresholds.</li>
  <li>Software/Application business is predominantly neutral but considered dual-use; no direct involvement in haram activities detected.</li>
  <li>Lack of segment-level details or haram revenue breakdown raises questions requiring board confirmation.</li>
  <li>QA identified two issues related to unidentified non-operational figures and borderline doubtful classification.</li>
  <li>Conservative approach recommended pending thorough Shariah board evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>

<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The overall Shariah verdict for AppLovin Corporation is <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong> with a screening status of <em>FAIL</em>. Quantitatively, the company reports very low levels of non-permissible income at 0.00% of total revenue, with modest debt and cash/investment ratios well within acceptable thresholds (debt at 1.47% and cash & investments at 0.37%). No purification is currently recommended or applied.</p>
<p>Qualitative assessments raise concerns due to incomplete disclosure regarding potential revenue exposure from forbidden activities such as alcohol, gambling, adult content, pork-related businesses, or conventional finance. As such, the Shariah compliance cannot be confirmed without further review.</p>
<p>The dual-use assessment indicates AppLovin operates an ad-tech/software platform considered neutral infrastructure, not inherently haram; however, its revenue mix depends on advertisers, which remains uncertain for Shariah compliance. Additional verification from the Shariah board is needed before inclusion.</p>

<p>The company fails Shariah compliance screening at this time due to insufficient information about possible exposure to impermissible activities. Despite quantitative ratios falling within limits, the lack of transparency around revenue sources and advertiser categories necessitates disqualification pending further board review.</p>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reported NPIN is 0.00%, indicating no direct income from haram sources as per available data.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash/investment ratios are minimal, well below threshold limits.</li>
  <li>No purification is deemed necessary currently.</li>
  <li>Uncertainty regarding revenue exposure to prohibited sectors due to incomplete disclosure.</li>
  <li>The neutral nature of the ad-tech platform does not guarantee compliance without detailed revenue source confirmation.</li>
  <li>Shariah guidelines emphasize avoiding doubtful matters and the principle of preventing assistance to sin (ta’awun ‘ala al-ithm).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>
Broadcom Inc. has undergone a quantitative and qualitative Shariah screening as of the report date 2025-12-11. Despite all numeric financial ratios being within acceptable limits—debt ratio at 3.41%, cash and investments at 0.85%, and Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) at 0.00%—the overall screening status is <strong>FAIL</strong>, leading to a final verdict of <strong>NON-COMPLIANT</strong>. The key issue is the lack of sufficient data on haram revenue segments or a definitive breakdown that would confirm the absence of material non-permissible activities.
</p>
<p>
The company’s products, including semiconductors and AI infrastructure software, are considered dual-use technologies and are not inherently haram; customer end-use does not automatically render the revenue non-permissible.
</p>
<p>
Due to uncertainty and incomplete information, a Shariah board review is recommended before making final investment decisions.

<h3>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>Haram Revenue Composition:</strong></p>
<p>Composition detail: N/A (not provided).</p>

<p><strong>Comments on Haram Sectors:</strong></p>
<p>The company’s products relate to dual-use/neutral technology; specifically, semiconductors and AI infrastructure software are not inherently haram. However, without clear and complete data on any material revenue from clearly prohibited sectors or activities, we are unable to conclusively verify full compliance. Customer use cases do not by themselves impact the permissibility of revenue recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Red Flag Sectors:</strong> None identified.</p>

<h3>References</h3>
<p>N/A (no haram references provided in the memo).</p>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>
The company is classified as <strong>NON-COMPLIANT</strong> due to insufficient evidence and lack of an explicit haram revenue estimate. Although all numeric criteria (debt, NPIN, cash ratios) fall within acceptable limits, the absence of disclosed material non-permissible income percentages and detailed segment allocation necessitates caution. A Shariah board review is essential to confirm the absence of material impermissible income and validate the screening methodology.
</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The reported NPIN ratio is 0.00%, implying no detected direct non-permissible income streams.</li>
  <li>Debt and liquidity ratios are well within acceptable Shariah screening limits.</li>
  <li>Dual-use technology classification indicates the company’s products are neutral, not inherently impermissible.</li>
  <li>Absence of data on haram revenue composition limits confident classification.</li>
  <li>Shariah compliance screening flagged the company's status as a “FAIL” due to missing haram revenue breakdown and incomplete disclosure.</li>
  <li>Purification is currently unnecessary due to zero NPIN reported and lack of identifiable impermissible income.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>
Until further confirmation and detailed disclosure are obtained through a Shariah board review, it is advised to <strong>hold or avoid</strong> this security within Islamic investment portfolios. The borderline nature of the screening results and insufficient transparency warrant caution in approval for Shariah-compliant investing.
</p>
<p>
Portfolio managers should monitor any updates on segment disclosures or board decisions regarding the materiality of non-permissible income and consider re-screening once additional information becomes available.

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>
Exxon Mobil Corporation passed initial quantitative Shariah screening with zero reported non-permissible income (NPIN) and compliant financial ratios (debt at 8.27%, cash & investments at 11.38%). However, due to the absence of detailed segment-level halal/haram breakdown and non-availability of a reliable haram income estimate, the final Shariah verdict is classified as <strong>DOUBTFUL_REVIEW</strong>. The company requires further Shariah board review to clarify potential non-permissible revenue streams and confirm if purification is necessary. Portfolio managers are advised to hold or avoid pending this review.
</p>

<h2>Company Overview</h2>
<p>
Exxon Mobil Corporation is a global integrated oil and gas company engaged in exploration, production, refining, and marketing of petroleum products. It operates in multiple energy-related sectors including upstream oil extraction, downstream refining and chemicals, as well as energy technology development. The company serves customers worldwide with an extensive value chain connecting crude oil sources to end consumers.

<h2>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h2>
<p><em>Composition detail: N/A (not provided).</em></p>
<p>
No segment-level or product-level haram revenue breakdown is available for Exxon Mobil Corporation. There is no reported non-permissible income according to quantitative screening; however, due to lack of supporting data, verification of potential prohibited income streams could not be completed.
</p>
<p>
The company’s integrated oil and gas operations are commercial energy activities rather than inherently dual-use or core-haram businesses. Nevertheless, confirmation with revenue splits and verification of absence or scale of prohibited income streams is pending.
</p>

<h3>References</h3>
<p><em>No haram references were provided for this review.</em></p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p>
The overall Shariah compliance verdict for Exxon Mobil Corporation is <strong>DOUBTFUL_REVIEW</strong>. While quantitative screening shows full compliance, the absence of reliable and detailed segment revenue data and non-permissible income estimates prevents a definitive approval. Purification is not currently required pending further verification.
</p>
<p>
The Shariah board review is recommended to resolve the doubt arising from incomplete information before proceeding with portfolio inclusion decisions.
</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No identified non-permissible income streams detected in current financial data.</li>
  <li>Debt and liquidity ratios are well within permissible limits.</li>
  <li>Lack of detailed revenue breakdown limits the ability to assess potential prohibited income.</li>
  <li>Integrated oil and gas sector activities are not inherently haram but require verification of revenue sources.</li>
  <li>Compliance subject to confirmation by Shariah board given current data gaps and borderline indicators.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>
Due to current classification as <em>DOUBTFUL_REVIEW</em> and data deficiencies, portfolio managers are advised to <strong>hold or avoid</strong> initiating or increasing exposure to Exxon Mobil Corporation until a conclusive Shariah board determination is made. Pending receipt of segmental revenue details and confirmation of prohibited income absence or immateriality, the investment position should be monitored closely for any material changes that impact compliance.

<p>
Applied Materials, Inc. has successfully passed the numeric Shariah financial ratio screens with a debt ratio of 3.05%, cash & investment ratio of 6.03%, and a 0.00% reported non-permissible income (NPIN) ratio, all well within permissible limits. However, due to missing or insufficient disclosures regarding haram revenue breakdowns and no identifiable haram segments, the overall Shariah verdict remains <em>DOUBTFUL_REVIEW</em>. The absence of reliable, detailed haram revenue percentages prevents a definitive determination under the 5% NPIN threshold rule despite numeric compliance. As such, a Shariah board review is recommended before portfolio inclusion.

<p>The assessment found no identifiable haram revenue segments or lines. The company’s primary business in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and related services is considered neutral or dual-use with commercial application.

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p>
<strong>Classification:</strong> DOUBTFUL_REVIEW<br>
<strong>Reason:</strong> The company's financial metrics comply with Shariah limits, reporting 0% NPIN and no identified haram revenues. However, the lack of reliable, detailed data on potentially impermissible income and missing haram segment disclosures preclude confirmation of compliance under the 5% NPIN threshold rule. Accordingly, full Shariah compliance cannot be confirmed without further review.
</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No direct involvement in clearly impermissible business activities recognized.</li>
  <li>Reported key financial ratios are well below Shariah thresholds.</li>
  <li>Dual-use nature of semiconductor manufacturing equipment signifies commercial and neutral use, but requires cautious interpretation.</li>
  <li>Incomplete or missing haram revenue breakdowns raise doubts about full adherence to Shariah standards.</li>
  <li>QA issues concerning unidentified non-operating USD amounts affect confidence level in data integrity.</li>
  <li>Advised adherence to principles of avoiding doubtful matters (gharar) and sin facilitation (ta’awun ‘ala al-ithm).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>Due to the borderline nature of this compliance status, portfolio managers are advised to <strong>hold or avoid new positions</strong> in Applied Materials, Inc. until the Shariah supervisory board conducts a thorough review. The current numeric pass is overridden by qualitative uncertainty stemming from missing haram revenue disclosure.

<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3>
<p>This Shariah compliance review for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. concludes a final classification of <strong>Non-Compliant</strong>. The screening status is <em>Fail</em> primarily due to its core business engagement in conventional banking—a sector categorically prohibited under Islamic finance principles. There are no reliable quantitative figures available for non-permissible income (NPIN) ratios or debt and cash investment ratios, and numeric data quality issues have been noted. No purification is currently recommended or applied. Portfolio managers are advised to avoid initiating new investments in this entity due to its persistent non-compliance under Shariah screening criteria.</p>

<h3>3. Company Overview</h3>
<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is a leading global financial services firm headquartered in the United States, known for its extensive operations in banking and asset management. It offers a wide range of financial products and services globally, including commercial banking, investment banking, wealth management, and treasury services.

<p>Quality assurance (QA) processes identified six significant data issues, including invalid ratios and thresholds exceeded. Specifically, reported debt and cash investment ratios are either missing or exceed permissible limits, further confirming the non-compliance status.</p>

<h3>5. Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>Industry Classification:</strong> The company operates in the <em>Banks - Diversified</em> sector, which is explicitly identified as forbidden due to its engagement in riba-based financial services.</p>
<p><strong>Dual-Use Assessment:</strong> Noted as <em>Non-Dual-Use</em>; the firm's core business—commercial and investment banking—is considered inherently riba-based and not neutral or permissible infrastructure.</p>

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> <em>Non-Compliant</em></p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. fails Shariah screening due to its involvement in prohibited financial activities within conventional banking. The absence of reliable financial ratio data and automatic exclusion based on industry classification confirms this conclusion. No purification effort is recommended at this time.</p>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Engagement in riba-based financial services violates core principles of Islamic finance.</li>
  <li>Lack of quantitative NPIN data introduces additional uncertainty, resulting in a cautious non-compliant verdict.</li>
  <li>High debt and cash investment levels (though numerically unavailable) are flagged as red flags in screening.</li>
  <li>Avoidance of doubtful and unclear financial information aligns with Shariah prudence.</li>
  <li>Automatic exclusion of firms in the conventional banking sector applies firmly to this company.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Given the conclusive non-compliance classification and automatic barring due to the banking sector, portfolio managers should <strong>avoid initiating new investments</strong> in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Current holdings require reevaluation under Shariah guidelines.

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The Bank of America Corporation has been assessed under the latest Shariah screening with a definitive <strong>non-compliant</strong> verdict. The company falls under the forbidden category of ""Banks - Diversified,"" which includes conventional banking activities inherently involving riba (interest). There is no available numeric data for non-permissible income (NPIN) due to data quality issues. Despite the absence of detailed NPIN ratios, the company’s industry classification alone warrants automatic exclusion based on Shariah principles. Quality assurance issues with key financial ratios further complicate the screening. No purification is currently recommended.</p>

<h2>Non-Permissible Income &amp; Haram Sector Assessment</h2>
<p>The company operates in the ""Banks - Diversified"" sector, which is categorically identified as non-permissible due to the inherent involvement in conventional interest-bearing banking activities. Conventional banking is considered riba-based and thus forbidden in Islamic finance.</p>
<p><strong>Haram Revenue Composition:</strong> Composition detail: N/A (not provided).</p>

<h3>References</h3>
<p>No specific haram references are provided in the data.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p>The final verdict for Bank of America Corporation is <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong>. The company’s primary business activities violate key Islamic principles due to involvement in conventional interest-based banking. The automatic ban applies, with no exception or purification method recommended. Portfolio managers are advised to avoid new investments in this company.</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Industry classification in ""Banks - Diversified"" aligns with forbidden sectors.</li>
  <li>Conventional banking is inherently riba-based, with no permissible dual-use justification.</li>
  <li>Data quality issues prevent quantitative confirmation of NPIN but do not affect the automatic industry-level ban.</li>
  <li>The company fails to meet the 5% NPIN threshold and other Shariah screening standards.</li>
  <li>Purification is not applicable as the company is fully non-compliant.</li>
  <li>Adherence to principles of avoiding assistance in sin and transgression (ta’awun ‘ala al-ithm) is paramount in this assessment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>Investment in Bank of America Corporation is strongly discouraged under current Shariah compliance frameworks. Given the automatic ban on companies operating in the conventional banking sector and the failure of key financial ratios to pass screening, portfolio managers should avoid new or incremental investments.

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) has been evaluated against Invesense’s rigorous Shariah screening criteria and has failed the screening process. The company operates in the diversified banking sector, which is automatically categorized as non-permissible due to the inherent riba (interest)-based activities. Key financial indicators required for detailed numeric analysis are unavailable or flagged with quality issues. As such, no purification is currently applied, and investment in this security is strongly discouraged from a Shariah perspective.</p>

<h2>Company Overview</h2>
<p>Wells Fargo & Company is a large, diversified financial services firm based in the United States, primarily engaged in universal banking activities including retail banking, wealth management, and corporate financial services. It serves a broad client base from individuals to multinational corporations. The company’s operations span various business segments centered on banking and financial intermediation, emphasizing credit and deposit services, asset management, and payment solutions.</p>

  <li><strong>Cash and Investments Ratio:</strong> N/A (Reported data missing or invalid)</li>
  <li><strong>Non-Permissible Income (NPIN) Ratio:</strong> N/A (No reliable figure available)</li>
  <li><strong>Purification Ratio:</strong> 0% (No purification applied)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> Multiple quality assurance (QA) issues were identified including invalid numeric ranges and absence of data, limiting detailed quantitative assessments. The debt and cash ratios exceeded acceptable thresholds or were unreported, confirming high financial risk from a Shariah perspective.</p>

<h2>Non-Permissible Income & Haram Sector Assessment</h2>
<p>The diversified banking industry, in which Wells Fargo operates, is categorized as inherently haram due to its reliance on interest (riba), which is explicitly prohibited under Shariah principles. The auto-ban is in place as conventional banking is not considered a neutral or dual-use business activity, and thus no revenue segmentation or detailed haram composition data is provided.</p>
<p><strong>Haram Revenue Composition:</strong> Composition detail: N/A (not provided).</p>

<h3>References</h3>
<p>No specific references provided for this report.</p>

<h2>Final Shariah Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>This classification is based on the company’s operations within the forbidden banking industry, which directly conflicts with Shariah prohibitions against riba and impermissible financial dealings. The lack of reliable NPIN metrics and the automatic industry ban solidifies this verdict. Investment is not permissible under Shariah guidelines.</p>

<h2>Key Shariah Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The company is auto-banned due to involvement in the conventional banking sector, which is unequivocally non-compliant with Shariah principles.</li>
  <li>No acceptable quantitative data is available to support detailed purification or adjusted compliance calculations.</li>
  <li>Conventional banking is inherently based on interest, which is impermissible in Islamic finance.</li>
  <li>The final verdict aligns with the principles of avoiding assisting in sin and avoiding doubtful matters where information is incomplete or ambiguous.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h2>
<p>Investments in Wells Fargo & Company are strongly discouraged given the clear non-compliance status. The company’s participation in the conventional banking sector renders it unsuitable for inclusion in Shariah-compliant portfolios.

<p><strong>Composition detail:</strong> N/A (not provided).</p>

<hr>

<h3>Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p>The company <strong>fails</strong> Shariah screening primarily because the tobacco industry is inherently haram and automatically deemed non-compliant. Despite the lack of specific numerical data on non-permissible income, the classification rule based on the industry alone results in a <strong>NON_COMPLIANT</strong> verdict.</p>

<h3>Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Industry Category: Tobacco — explicitly prohibited.</li>
  <li>No dual-use assessment claim; tobacco is inherently haram, not a neutral or dual-use sector.</li>
  <li>QA Issues: Data reliability concerns with multiple invalid financial metrics.</li>
  <li>Purification is not required given the automatic industry ban.</li>
  <li>Shariah references emphasize a 5% NPIN threshold, avoidance of sin collaboration (ta’awun ‘ala al-ithm), and precaution against doubtful matters in incomplete data scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance for Portfolio Managers</h3>
<p>Given the automatic non-compliance classification due to involvement in the tobacco sector, <strong>avoid new investments</strong> in Philip Morris International Inc. This position aligns with Shariah principles against supporting prohibited industries. Ongoing monitoring is recommended for any regulatory or operational developments, but current assessments mandate exclusion from Shariah-compliant portfolios.</p>",,,TRUE,FAIL,"Industry ""Tobacco"" matches forbidden category (""tobacco"") – automatically non Shariah compliant.","FAIL — Industry ""Tobacco"" matches forbidden category (""tobacco"") – automatically non Shariah compliant.",Non-Compliant,"Philip Morris International is non-compliant due to its core tobacco business, an automatically forbidden industry in Shariah screening.

<h3>6. Final Shariah Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Overall Verdict:</strong> NON_COMPLIANT</p>
<p>The primary driver of non-compliance is the automatic ban on the asset management industry under Shariah screening policies. Given the nature of Blackstone Inc.’s business and the absence of acceptable NPIN data or purification measures, the company is deemed non-permissible for Shariah-compliant investing.</p>

<hr>

<h3>7. Key Shariah Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Asset management activities are categorically forbidden as per current Shariah screening guidelines.</li>
  <li>Debt and cash investment ratios could not be validated, with reported data failing acceptable thresholds.</li>
  <li>Lack of reliable NPIN figures prevents accurate purification analysis.</li>
  <li>The screening process emphasizes avoiding industries that involve assisting in sin or doubtful matters, reinforcing the non-compliant decision.</li>
</ul>
